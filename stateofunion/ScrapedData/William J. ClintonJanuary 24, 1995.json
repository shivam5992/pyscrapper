    "speech": "Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the 104th Congress, my fellow\nAmericans:Again we are here in the sanctuary of democracy. And once again, our\ndemocracy has spoken.So let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress,\nand congratulating you, Mr. Speaker.If we agree on nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American people\ncertainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994.And as I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in 1992.I must say that in both years we didn't hear America singing, we heard\nAmerica shouting. And now all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, must\nsay: We hear you. We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us.\nFor we are the keepers of the sacred trust and we must be faithful to it in\nthis new and very demanding era.Over 200 years ago, our founders changed the entire course of human history\nby joining together to create a new country based on a single, powerful\nidea. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created\nequal, endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights. Among\nthese are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.It has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that idea--the\nAmerican idea--and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different\ntimes. To Lincoln and to his Congress, to preserve the Union and to end\nslavery. To Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, to restrain the abuses\nand excesses of the Industrial Revolution and to assert our leadership in\nthe world. To Franklin Roosevelt, to fight the failure and pain of the\nGreat Depression and to win our country's great struggle against fascism.And to all our Presidents since, to fight the cold war. Especially, I\nrecall two who struggled to fight that cold war in partnership with\nCongresses where the majority was of a different party. To Harry Truman,\nwho summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the\narchitecture of the cold war. And to Ronald Reagan, whom we wish well\ntonight, and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle\nagainst Communism was won.In another time of change and challenge, I had the honor to be the first\nPresident to be elected in the post-cold-war era, an era marked by the\nglobal economy, the information revolution, unparalleled change in\nopportunity and in security for the American people.I came to this hallowed chamber two years ago on a mission: To restore the\nAmerican dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the\n21st century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the\nentire world.I was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored. In\nthis effort I am frank to say that I have made my mistakes. And I have\nlearned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor.But I am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it was\ntwo years ago.AccomplishmentsRecord numbers, record numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new\nglobal economy. We are at peace, and we are a force for peace and freedom\nthroughout the world. We have almost six million new jobs since I became\nPresident, and we have the lowest combined rate of unemployment and\ninflation in 25 years.Our businesses are more productive and here we have worked to bring the\ndeficit down, to expand trade, to put more police on our streets, to give\nour citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to rebuild\ntheir own communities. But the rising tide is not lifting all the boats.While our nation is enjoying peace and prosperity, too many of our people\nare still working harder and harder for less and less. While our businesses\nare restructuring and growing more productive and competitive, too many of\nour people still can't be sure of having a job next year or even next\nmonth. And far more than our material riches are threatened, things far\nmore precious to us: our children, our families, our values.Our civil life is suffering in America today. Citizens are working together\nless and shouting at each other more. The common bonds of community which\nhave been the great strength of our country from its very beginning are\nbadly frayed.What are we to do about it?More than 60 years ago at the dawn of another new era, President Roosevelt\ntold our nation new conditions impose new requirements on Government and\nthose who conduct Government. And from that simple proposition he shaped\nthe New Deal, which helped to restore our nation to prosperity and defined\nthe relationship between our people and their Government for half a\ncentury.That approach worked in its time but today we face a very different time\nand very different conditions. We are moving from an industrial age built\non gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills and learning and\nflexibility.Our Government, once a champion of national purpose, is now seen by many as\nsimply a captive of narrow interests putting more burdens on our citizens\nrather than equipping them to get ahead. The values that used to hold us\nall together seem to be coming apart.So tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of\nthis time. As we enter a new era, we need a new set of understandings not\njust with Government but, even more important, with one another as\nAmericans.New CovenantThat's what I want to talk with you about tonight. I call it the New\nCovenant but it's grounded in a very, very old idea that all Americans have\nnot just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as their\nGod-given talents and determination can take them. And to give something\nback to their communities and their country in return.Opportunity and responsibility--they go hand in hand; we can't have one\nwithout the other, and our national community can't hold together without\nboth.Our New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip our\npeople to meet the challenges of the new economy, how we can change the way\nour Government works to fit a different time and, above all, how we can\nrepair the damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our common\npurpose. We must have dramatic change in our economy, our Government and\nourselves.My fellow Americans, without regard to party, let us rise to the occasion.\nLet us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride. As we embark on this\ncourse, let us put our country first, remembering that regardless of party\nlabel we are all Americans. And let the final test of everything we do be a\nsimple one: Is it good for the American people?Let me begin by saying that we cannot ask Americans to be better citizens\nif we are not better servants. You made a good start by passing that law\nwhich applies to Congress all the laws you put on the private sector--and\nI was proud to sign it yesterday.But we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things work\naround here. Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and corridors\nof Washington as were here 20 years ago. The American people look at their\ncapital and they see a city where the well-connected and the well-protected\ncan work the system, but the interests of ordinary citizens are often left\nout.As the new Congress opened its doors, lobbyists were still doing business\nas usual--the gifts, the trips--all the things that people are concerned\nabout haven't stopped.Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices. I know\nthere were other considerations in those votes, but I want to use something\nthat I've heard my Republican friends say from time to time: There doesn't\nhave to be a law for everything.So tonight I ask you to just stop taking the lobbyists' perks, just stop.We don't have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to\nthe American people that things are really changing. But I also hope you\nwill send me the strongest possible lobby reform bill, and I'll sign that,\ntoo. We should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they work what\nthey're spending, what they want. We should also curb the role of big money\nin elections by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting the influence of\nPAC's.And as I have said for three years, we should work to open the air waves so\nthat they can be an instrument of democracy not a weapon of destruction by\ngiving free TV time to candidates for public office.When the last Congress killed political reform last year, it was reported\nin the press that the lobbyists actually stood in the halls of this sacred\nbuilding and cheered. This year, let's give the folks at home something to\ncheer about.More important, I think we all agree that we have to change the way the\nGovernment works. Let's make it smaller, less costly and smarter. Leaner\nnot meaner.I just told the Speaker the equal time doctrine's alive and well.The Role Of GovernmentThe New Covenant approach to governing is as different from the old\nbureaucratic way as the computer is from the manual typewriter. The old way\nof governing around here protected organized interests; we should look out\nfor the interests of ordinary people. The old way divided us by interests,\nconstituency or class; the New Covenant way should unite us behind a common\nvision of what's best for our country.The old way dispensed services through large, top-down, inflexible\nbureaucracies. The New Covenant way should shift these resources and\ndecision making from bureaucrats to citizens, injecting choice and\ncompetition and individual responsibility into national policy.The old way of governing around here actually seemed to reward failure. The\nNew Covenant way should have built-in incentives to reward success.The old way was centralized here in Washington. The New Covenant way must\ntake hold in the communities all across America, and we should help them to\ndo that.Our job here is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy, to empower people\nto make the most of their own lives and to enhance our security here at\nhome and abroad.We must not ask Government to do what we should do for ourselves. We should\nrely on Government as a partner to help us to do more for ourselves and for\neach other.I hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matters, we\ncan go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there is\nsomehow a program for every problem, on the one hand, and the other\nillusion that the Government is the source of every problem that we have.Our job is to get rid of yesterday's Government so that our own people can\nmeet today's and tomorrow's needs.And we ought to do it together.You know, for years before I became President, I heard others say they\nwould cut Government and how bad it was. But not much happened.We actually did it. We cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in\nspending, more than 300 domestic programs, more than 100,000 positions from\nthe Federal bureaucracy in the last two years alone.Based on decisions already made, we will have cut a total of more than a\nquarter of a million positions from the Federal Government, making it the\nsmallest it has been since John Kennedy was president, by the time I come\nhere again next year.Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, our initiatives have already\nsaved taxpayers $ 63 billion. The age of the $ 500 hammer and the ashtray\nyou can break on David Letterman is gone. Deadwood programs like mohair\nsubsidies are gone. We've streamlined the Agriculture Department by\nreducing it by more than 1,200 offices. We've slashed the small-business\nloan form from an inch thick to a single page. We've thrown away the\nGovernment's 10,000-page personnel manual.And the Government is working better in important ways. FEMA, the Federal\nEmergency Management Agency, has gone from being a disaster to helping\npeople in disaster.You can ask the farmers in the Middle West who fought the flood there or\nthe people in California who've dealt with floods and earthquakes and fires\nand they'll tell you that.Government workers, working hand-in-hand with private business, rebuilt\nSouthern California's fractured freeways in record time and under budget.And because the Federal Government moved fast, all but one of the 5,600\nschools damaged in the earthquake are back in business.Now, there are a lot of other things that I could talk about. I want to\njust mention one because it'll be discussed here in the next few weeks.University administrators all over the country have told me that they are\nsaving weeks and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct\ncollege loan program, which makes college loans cheaper and more affordable\nwith better repayment terms for students, costs the Government less and\ncuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for the Government and for the\nuniversities.We shouldn't cap that program, we should give every college in America the\nopportunity to be a part of it.Previous Government programs gather dust; the reinventing Government report\nis getting results. And we're not through--there's going to be a second\nround of reinventing Government.We propose to cut $ 130 billion in spending by shrinking departments,\nextending our freeze on domestic spending, cutting 60 public housing\nprograms down to 3, getting rid of over a hundred programs we do not need\nlike the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Helium Reserve Program.And we're working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making them\nmore sensible. The programs and regulations that have outlived their\nusefulness should go. We have to cut yesterday's Government to help solve\ntomorrow's problems.And we need to get Government closer to the people it's meant to serve. We\nneed to help move programs down to the point where states and communities\nand private citizens in the private sector can do a better job. If they can\ndo it, we ought to let them do it. We should get out of the way and let\nthem do what they can do better.Community EmpowermentTaking power away from Federal bureaucracies and giving it back to\ncommunities and individuals is something everyone should be able to be for.\nIt's time for Congress to stop passing onto the states the cost of\ndecisions we make here in Washington.I know there are still serious differences over the details of the unfunded\nmandates legislation but I want to work with you to make sure we pass a\nreasonable bill which will protect the national interest and give justified\nrelief where we need to give it.For years, Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet spending\nprojects. Last year was no different. There was a million dollars to study\nstress in plants and $ 12 million for a tick removal program that didn't\nwork. It's hard to remove ticks; those of us who've had them know.But I'll tell you something, if you'll give me the line-item veto, I'll\nremove some of that unnecessary spending.But, I think we should all remember, and almost all of us would agree, that\nGovernment still has important responsibilities.Our young people--we should think of this when we cut--our young people\nhold our future in their hands. We still owe a debt to our veterans. And\nour senior citizens have made us what we are.BudgetNow, my budget cuts a lot. But it protects education, veterans, Social\nSecurity and Medicare, and I hope you will do the same thing. You should,\nand I hope you will.And when we give more flexibility to the states, let us remember that there\nare certain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in every\nstate, north and south, east and west.Immunization against childhood disease, school lunches in all our schools,\nHead Start, medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants--all\nthese things are in the national interest.I applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations, but\nwhen we deregulate let's remember what national action in the national\ninterest has given us: safer food for our families, safer toys for our\nchildren, safer nursing homes for our parents, safer cars and highways and\nsafer workplaces, cleaner air and cleaner water. Do we need common sense\nand fairness in our regulations? You bet we do. But we can have common\nsense and still provide for safe drinking water. We can have fairness and\nstill clean up toxic dumps and we ought to do it.Should we cut the deficit more? Well of course we should. Of course we\nshould. But we can bring it down in a way that still protects our economic\nrecovery and does not unduly punish people who should not be punished, but\ninstead should be helped.I know many of you in this chamber support the balanced-budget amendment. I\ncertainly want to balance the budget. Our Administration has done more to\nbring the budget down and to save money than any in a very, very long\ntime.If you believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do, then you\nhave to be straight with the American people. They have a right to know\nwhat you're going to cut, what taxes you're going to raise, how it's going\nto affect them.And we should be doing things in the open around here. For example,\neverybody ought to know if this proposal is going to endanger Social\nSecurity. I would oppose that, and I think most Americans would.WelfareNothing is done more to undermine our sense of common responsibility than\nour failed welfare system. This is one of the problems we have to face here\nin Washington in our New Covenant. It rewards welfare over work, it\nundermines family values, it lets millions of parents get away without\npaying their child support, it keeps a minority--but a significant\nminority--of the people on welfare trapped on it for a very long time.I worked on this problem for a long time--nearly 15 years now. As a\nGovernor I had the honor of working with the Reagan Administration to write\nthe last welfare reform bill back in 1988.In the last two years we made a good start in continuing the work of\nwelfare reform. Our Administration gave two dozen states the right to slash\nthrough Federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare systems\nand to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency.Last year, I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever\npresented by an Administration. We have to make welfare what it was meant\nto be--a second chance, not a way of life.We have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible, to\nprovide child care and teach them skills, if that's what they need, for up\nto two years. But after that, there ought to be a simple, hard rule. Anyone\nwho can work must go to work.If a parent isn't paying child support, they should be forced to pay.We should suspend driver's licenses, track them across state lines, make\nthem work off what they owe. That is what we should do. Governments do not\nraise children, people do. And the parents must take responsibility for the\nchildren they bring into this world.I want to work with you, with all of you, to pass welfare reform. But our\ngoal must be to liberate people and lift them from dependence to\nindependence, from welfare to work, from mere childbearing to responsible\nparenting. Our goal should not be to punish them because they happen to be\npoor.We should--we should require work and mutual responsibility. But we\nshouldn't cut people off just because they're poor, they're young or even\nbecause they're unmarried. We should promote responsibility by requiring\nyoung mothers to live at home with their parents or in other supervised\nsettings, by requiring them to finish school. But we shouldn't put them and\ntheir children out on the street.And I know all the arguments pro and con and I have read and thought about\nthis for a long time: I still don't think we can, in good conscience,\npunish poor children for the mistakes of their parents.My fellow Americans, every single survey shows that all the American people\ncare about this, without regard to party or race or region. So let this be\nthe year we end welfare as we know it.But also let this be the year that we are all able to stop using this issue\nto divide America.No one is more eager to end welfare.I may be the only President who's actually had the opportunity to sit in\nthe welfare office, who's actually spent hours and hours talking to people\non welfare, and I am telling you the people who are trapped on it know it\ndoesn't work. They also want to get off.So we can promote, together, education and work and good parenting. I have\nno problem with punishing bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a\nstudent or a responsible parent. I just don't want to punish poverty and\npast mistakes. All of us have made our mistakes and none of us can change\nour yesterdays, but every one of us can change our tomorrows.And America's best example of that may be Lynn Woolsey, who worked her way\noff welfare to become a Congresswoman from the state of California.CrimeI know the members of this Congress are concerned about crime, as are all\nthe citizens of our country. But I remind you that last year we passed a\nvery tough crime bill--longer sentences, three strikes and you're out,\nalmost 60 new capital punishment offenses, more prisons, more prevention,\n100,000 more police--and we paid for it all by reducing the size of the\nFederal bureaucracy and giving the money back to local communities to lower\nthe crime rate.There may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime, to be smarter\nwith crime, to help to lower that rate first. Well if there are, let's talk\nabout them and let's do them. But let's not go back on the things that we\ndid last year that we know work--that we know work because the local\nlaw-enforcement officers tell us that we did the right thing. Because local\ncommunity leaders, who've worked for years and years to lower the crime\nrate, tell us that they work.Let's look at the experience of our cities and our rural areas where the\ncrime rate has gone down and ask the people who did it how they did it and\nif what we did last year supports the decline in the crime rate, and I am\nconvinced that it does, let us not go back on it, let's stick with it,\nimplement it--we've got four more hard years of work to do to do that.I don't want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country\ntonight, but I have to mention one issue that divided this body greatly\nlast year. The last Congress also passed the Brady bill and in the crime\nbill the ban on 19 assault weapons.I don't think it's a secret to anybody in this room that several members of\nthe last Congress who voted for that aren't here tonight because they voted\nfor it. And I know, therefore, that some of you that are here because they\nvoted for it are under enormous pressure to repeal it. I just have to tell\nyou how I feel about it.The members who voted for that bill and I would never do anything to\ninfringe on the right to keep and bear arms to hunt and to engage in other\nappropriate sporting activities. I've done it since I was a boy, and I'm\ngoing to keep right on doing it until I can't do it anymore.But a lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police\nofficers and kids wouldn't have to lay down their lives under a hail of\nassault-weapon attacks, and I will not let that be repealed. I will not let\nit be repealed.I'd like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with. I\nwant us to cut more spending, but I hope we won't cut Government programs\nthat help to prepare us for the new economy, promote responsibility and are\norganized from the grass roots up, not by Federal bureaucracy.The very best example of this is the National Service Corps--AmeriCorps.\nIt passed with strong bipartisan support and now there are 20,000 Americans\n--more than ever served in one year in the Peace Corps--working all over\nthis country, helping person to person in local grass-roots volunteer\ngroups, solving problems and in the process earning some money for their\neducation.This is citizenship at its best. It's good for the AmeriCorps members, but\nit's good for the rest of us, too. It's the essence of the New Covenant and\nwe shouldn't stop it.Illegal ImmigrationAll Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected, but in every\nplace in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal\naliens entering our country.The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants.\nThe public services they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why\nour Administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more, by\nhiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many\ncriminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by\nbarring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the\ndeportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better\nidentify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission\nheaded by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. It is\nwrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit\nthe kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and\nwe must do more to stop it.The most important job of our Government in this new era is to empower the\nAmerican people to succeed in the global economy. America has always been a\nland of opportunity, a land where, if you work hard, you can get ahead.\nWe've become a great middle-class country; middle-class values sustain us.\nWe must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass even as we do\neverything we can to support the millions of Americans who are already\nsuccessful in the new economy.America is once again the world's strongest economic power: almost six\nmillion new jobs in the last two years, exports booming, inflation down,\nhigh-wage jobs are coming back. A record number of American entrepreneurs\nare living the American dream.If we want it to stay that way, those who work and lift our nation must\nhave more of its benefits.Today, too many of those people are being left out. They're working harder\nfor less. They have less security, less income, less certainty that they\ncan even afford a vacation, much less college for their kids or retirement\nfor themselves.We cannot let this continue. If we don't act, our economy will probably\nkeep doing what it's been doing since about 1978, when the income growth\nbegan to go to those at the very top of our economic scale. And the people\nin the vast middle got very little growth and people who worked like crazy\nbut were on the bottom then, fell even further and further behind in the\nyears afterward, no matter how hard they worked.We've got to have a Government that can be a real partner in making this\nnew economy work for all of our people, a Government that helps each and\nevery one of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew\nour skills.EducationThat's why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in the\nlast two years from Head Start to public schools to apprenticeships for\nyoung people who don't go to college, to making college loans more\navailable and more affordable.That's the first thing we have to do: We've got to do something to empower\npeople to improve their skills.TaxesSecond thing we ought to do is to help people raise their incomes\nimmediately by lowering their taxes.We took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax cut for 15 million\nfamilies with incomes under $ 27,000, a tax cut that this year will average\nabout $ 1,000 a family.And we also gave tax reductions to most small and new businesses. Before we\ncould do more than that, we first had to bring down the deficit we\ninherited and we had to get economic growth up. Now we've done both, and\nnow we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way.But tax cuts should reinforce and promote our first obligation: to empower\nour citizens through education and training to make the most of their own\nlives. The spotlight should shine on those who make the right choices for\nthemselves, their families and their communities.Middle Class Bill Of RightsI have proposed a middle-class bill of rights, which should properly be\ncalled the bill of rights and responsibilities, because its provisions only\nbenefit those who are working to educate and raise their children and to\neducate themselves. It will, therefore, give needed tax relief and raise\nincomes, in both the short run and the long run, in a way that benefits all\nof us.There are four provisions:First, a tax deduction for all education and training after high school. If\nyou think about it, we permit businesses to deduct their investment, we\npermit individuals to deduct interest on their home mortgages, but today an\neducation is even more important to the economic well-being of our whole\ncountry than even those things are. We should do everything we can to\nencourage it, and I hope you will support it.Second, we ought to cut taxes $ 500 for families with children under 13.Third, we ought to foster more savings and personal responsibility by\npermitting people to establish an individual retirement account and\nwithdraw from it tax free for the cost of education, health care,\nfirst-time home buying or the care of a parent.And fourth, we should pass a G.I. bill for America's workers. We propose to\ncollapse nearly 70 Federal programs and not give the money to the states\nbut give the money directly to the American people, offer vouchers to them\nso that they--if they're laid off or if they're working for a very low\nwage--can get a voucher worth $ 2,600 a year for up to two years to go to\ntheir local community colleges or wherever else they want to get the skills\nthey need to improve their lives. Let's empower people in this way. Move it\nfrom the Government directly to the workers of America.Cutting The Deficit NowAny one of us can call for a tax cut, but I won't accept one that explodes\nthe deficit or puts our recovery at risk. We ought to pay for our tax cuts\nfully and honestly. Just two years ago it was an open question whether we\nwould find the strength to cut the deficit.Thanks to the courage of the people who were here then, many of whom didn't\nreturn, we did cut the deficit. We began to do what others said would not\nbe done: We cut the deficit by over $ 600 billion, about $ 10,000 for every\nfamily in this country. It's coming down three years in a row for the first\ntime since Mr. Truman was President and I don't think anybody in America\nwants us to let it explode again.In the budget I will send you, the middle-class bill of rights is fully\npaid for by budget cuts in bureaucracy, cuts in programs, cuts in special\ninterest subsidies. And the spending cuts will more than double the tax\ncuts. My budget pays for the middle-class bill of rights without any cuts\nin Medicare, and I will oppose any attempts to pay for tax cuts with\nMedicare cuts. That's not the right thing to do.I know that a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief. And some of\nthem, I find quite interesting. I really want to work with all of you.My tests for our proposals will be: Will it create jobs and raise incomes?\nWill it strengthen our families and support our children? Is it paid for?\nWill it build the middle class and shrink the underclass?If it does, I'll support it. But if it doesn't, I won't.Minimum WageThe goal of building the middle class and shrinking the underclass is also\nwhy I believe that you should raise the minimum wage.It rewards work--two and a half million Americans, often women with\nchildren, are working out there today for four-and-a-quarter an hour. In\nterms of real buying power, by next year, that minimum wage will be at a\n40-year low. That's not my idea of how the new economy ought to work.Now I studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a minimum-wage\nincrease. I believe the weight of the evidence is that a modest increase\ndoes not cost jobs and may even lure people back into the job market. But\nthe most important thing is you can't make a living on $ 4.25 an hour. Now\n--especially if you have children, even with the working families tax cut\nwe passed last year.In the past, the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue and I think it\nshould be again. So I want to challenge you to have honest hearings on\nthis, to get together to find a way to make the minimum wage a living\nwage.Members of Congress have been here less than a month but by the end of the\nweek--28 days into the new year--every member of Congress will have\nearned as much in congressional salary as a minimum-wage worker makes all\nyear long.Everybody else here, including the President, has something else that too\nmany Americans do without and that's health care.Health CareNow, last year we almost came to blows over health care, but we didn't do\nanything. And the cold, hard fact is that since last year--since I was\nhere--another 1.1 million Americans in working families have lost their\nhealth care. And the cold, hard fact is that many millions more--most of\nthem farmers and small business people and self-employed people--have\nseen their premiums skyrocket, their co-pays and deductibles go up.There's a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistics have\nhealth insurance but really what they've got is a piece of paper that says\nthey won't lose their home if they get sick.Now I still believe our country has got to move toward providing health\nsecurity for every American family, but--but I know that last year, as the\nevidence indicates, we bit off more than we could chew.So I'm asking you that we work together. Let's do it step by step. Let's do\nwhatever we have to do to get something done. Let's at least pass\nmeaningful insurance reform so that no American risks losing coverage for\nfacing skyrocketing prices but that nobody loses their coverage because\nthey face high prices or unavailable insurance when they change jobs or\nlose a job or a family member gets sick.I want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this: with\nthe Democrats who worked on it last time, with the Republican leaders like\nSenator Dole who has a longtime commitment to health care reform and made\nsome constructive proposals in this area last year. We ought to make sure\nthat self-employed people in small businesses can buy insurance at more\naffordable rates through voluntary purchasing pools. We ought to help\nfamilies provide long-term care for a sick parent to a disabled child. We\ncan work to help workers who lose their jobs at least keep their health\ninsurance coverage for a year while they look for work, and we can find a\nway--it may take some time, but we can find a way--to make sure that our\nchildren have health care.You know, I think everybody in this room, without regard to party, can be\nproud of the fact that our country was rated as having the world's most\nproductive economy for the first time in nearly a decade, but we can't be\nproud of the fact that we're the only wealthy country in the world that has\na smaller percentage of the work force and their children with health\ninsurance today than we did 10 years ago--the last time we were the most\nproductive economy in the world.So let's work together on this. It is too important for politics as usual.Much of what the American people are thinking about tonight is what we've\nalready talked about. A lot of people think that the security concerns of\nAmerica today are entirely internal to our borders, they relate to the\nsecurity of our jobs and our homes and our incomes and our children, our\nstreets, our health and protecting those borders.Foreign PolicyNow that the Cold War has passed, it's tempting to believe that all the\nsecurity issues, with the possible exception of trade, reside here at home.\nBut it's not so. Our security still depends on our continued world\nleadership for peace and freedom and democracy. We still can't be strong at\nhome unless we're strong abroad.MexicoThe financial crisis in Mexico is a case in point. I know it's not popular\nto say it tonight but we have to act, not for the Mexican people but for\nthe sake of the millions of Americans whose livelihoods are tied to\nMexico's well-being. If we want to secure American jobs, preserve American\nexports, safeguard America's borders then we must pass the stabilization\nprogram and help to put Mexico back on track.Now let me repeat: it's not a loan, it's not foreign aid, it's not a\nbail-out. We'll be given a guarantee like co-signing a note with good\ncollateral that will cover our risk.This legislation is the right thing for America. That's why the bipartisan\nleadership has supported it. And I hope you in Congress will pass it\nquickly. It is in our interest and we can explain it to the American\npeople, because we're going to do it in the right way.RussiaYou know, tonight this is the first State of the Union address ever\ndelivered since the beginning of the cold war when not a single Russian\nmissile is pointed at the children of America.And along with the Russians, we're on our way to destroying the missiles\nand the bombers that carry 9,000 nuclear warheads. We've come so far so\nfast in this post-cold-war world that it's easy to take the decline of the\nnuclear threat for granted. But it's still there, and we aren't finished\nyet.This year, I'll ask the Senate to approve START II to eliminate weapons\nthat carry 5,000 more warheads. The United States will lead the charge to\nextend indefinitely the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to enact a\ncomprehensive nuclear test ban, and to eliminate chemical weapons.North KoreaTo stop and roll back North Korea's potentially deadly nuclear program,\nwe'll continue to implement the agreement we have reached with that nation.\nIt's smart, it's tough, it's a deal based on continuing inspection with\nsafeguards for our allies and ourselves.This year, I'll submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen\nour hand in combating terrorists, whether they strike at home or abroad. As\nthe cowards who bombed the World Trade Center found out, this country will\nhunt down terrorists and bring them to justice.Middle EastJust this week, another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 and\ninjured scores more. On behalf of the American people and all of you, I\nsend our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. I know that in\nthe face of such evil, it is hard for the people in the Middle East to go\nforward. But the terrorists represent the past, not the future. We must and\nwe will pursue a comprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors\nin the Middle East.Accordingly, last night I signed an executive order that will block the\nassets in the United States of terrorist organizations that threaten to\ndisrupt the peace process. It prohibits financial transactions with these\ngroups.And tonight I call on all our allies in peace-loving nations throughout the\nworld to join us with renewed fervor in a global effort to combat\nterrorism, we cannot permit the future to be marred by terror and fear and\nparalysis.DefenseFrom the day I took the oath of office, I pledged that our nation would\nmaintain the best-equipped, best-trained and best-prepared military on\nearth. We have and they are. They have managed the dramatic downsizing of\nour forces after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit. But to make\nsure our military is ready for action and to provide the pay and the\nquality of life the military and their families deserve, I'm asking the\nCongress to add $ 25 billion in defense spending over the next six years.I have visited many bases at home and around the world since I became\nPresident. Tonight I repeat that request with renewed conviction. We ask a\nvery great deal of our armed forces. Now that they are smaller in number,\nwe ask more of them. They go out more often to more different places and\nstay longer. They are called to service in many, many ways, and we must\ngive them and their families what the times demand and what they have\nearned.Just think about what our troops have done in the last year, showing\nAmerica at its best, helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in\nRwanda, moving with lightning speed to head off another threat to Kuwait,\ngiving freedom and democracy back to the people of Haiti.We have proudly supported peace and prosperity and freedom from South\nAfrica to Northern Ireland, from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia, from\nLatin America to the Middle East. All these endeavors are good in those\nplaces but they make our future more confident and more secure.Well, my fellow Americans, that's my agenda for America's future: expanding\nopportunity not bureaucracy, enhancing security at home and abroad,\nempowering our people to make the most of their own lives.It's ambitious and achievable. But it's not enough.We even need more than new ideas for changing the world or equipping\nAmericans to compete in the new economy, more than a Government that's\nsmaller, smarter and wiser, more than all the changes we can make in\nGovernment and in the private sector from the outside in.Values And VoicesOur fortunes and our prosperity also depend upon our ability to answer some\nquestions from within--from the values and voices that speak to our hearts\nas well as our heads, voices that tell us we have to do more to accept\nresponsibility for ourselves and our families, for our communities, and\nyes, for our fellow citizens.We see our families and our communities all over this country coming apart.\nAnd we feel the common ground shifting from under us. The PTA, the town\nhall meeting, the ball park--it's hard for a lot of overworked parents to\nfind the time and space for those things that strengthen the bonds of trust\nand cooperation.Too many of our children don't even have parents and grandparents who can\ngive them those experiences that they need to build their own character and\ntheir sense of identity. We all know that while we here in this chamber can\nmake a difference on those things, that the real differences will be made\nby our fellow citizens where they work and where they live.And it'll be made almost without regard to party. When I used to go to the\nsoftball park in Little Rock to watch my daughter's league and people would\ncome up to me--fathers and mothers--and talk to me, I can honestly say I\nhad no idea whether 90 percent of them were Republicans or Democrats.When I visited the relief centers after the floods in California, Northern\nCalifornia, last week, a woman came up to me and did something that very\nfew of you would do. She hugged me and said, \"Mr. President, I'm a\nRepublican, but I'm glad you're here.\"Now, why? We can't wait for disasters to act the way we used to act every\nday. Because as we move into this next century, everybody matters. We don't\nhave a person to waste. And a lot of people are losing a lot of chances to\ndo better.That means that we need a New Covenant for everybody--for our corporate\nand business leaders, we're going to work here to keep bringing the deficit\ndown, to expand markets, to support their success in every possible way.\nBut they have an obligation: when they're doing well, to keep jobs in our\ncommunities and give their workers a fair share of the prosperity they\ngenerate.For people in the entertainment industry in this country, we applaud your\ncreativity and your worldwide success and we support your freedom of\nexpression but you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your\nwork and to understand the damage that comes from the incessant,\nrepetitive, mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeates our\nmedia all the time.We've got to ask our community leaders and all kinds of organizations to\nhelp us stop our most serious social problem: the epidemic of teen\npregnancies and births where there is no marriage. I have sent to Congress\na plan to target schools all over this country with anti-pregnancy programs\nthat work. But government can only do so much. Tonight, I call on parents\nand leaders all across this country to join together in a national campaign\nagainst teen pregnancy to make a difference. We can do this and we must.And I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders. You know,\nI'm proud of the fact that the United States has more house of worship per\ncapita than any country in the world. These people, who lead our houses of\nworship, can ignite their congregations to carry their faith into action,\ncan reach out to all of our children, to all of the people in distress, to\nthose who have been savaged by the breakdown of all we hold dear, because\nso much of what must be done must come from the inside out. And our\nreligious leaders and their congregations can make all the difference. They\nhave a role in the New Covenant as well.There must be more responsibility for all of our citizens. You know it\ntakes a lot of people to help all the kids in trouble stay off the streets\nand in school. It takes a lot of people to build the Habitat for Humanity\nhouses that the Speaker celebrates on his lapel pin. It takes a lot of\npeople to provide the people power for all the civic organizations in this\ncountry that made our communities mean so much to most of us when we were\nkids. It takes every parent to teach the children the difference between\nright and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and to say no to\nthe wrong things but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to\nbe.I know it's hard when you're working harder for less, when you're under\ngreat stress, to do these things. A lot of our people don't have the time\nor the emotional stress they think to do the work of citizenship. Most of\nus in politics haven't helped very much. For years, we've mostly treated\ncitizens like they were consumers or spectators, sort of political couch\npotatoes who were supposed to watch the TV ads--either promise them\nsomething for nothing or play on their fears and frustrations. And more and\nmore of our citizens now get most of their information in very negative and\naggressive ways that is hardly conducive to honest and open conversations.\nBut the truth is we have got to stop seeing each other as enemies just\nbecause we have different views.If you go back to the beginning of this country, the great strength of\nAmerica, as de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago,\nhas always been our ability to associate with people who were different\nfrom ourselves and to work together to find common ground. And in this day\neverybody has a responsibility to do more of that. We simply cannot wait\nfor a tornado, a fire or a flood to behave like Americans ought to behave\nin dealing with one another.I want to finish up here by pointing out some folks that are up with the\nFirst Lady that represent what I'm trying to talk about. Citizens. I have\nno idea what their party affiliation is or who they voted for in the last\nelection, but they represent what we ought to be doing.Cindy Perry teaches second-graders to read in AmeriCorps in rural Kentucky.\nShe gains when she gives. She's a mother of four.She says that her service inspired her to get her high school equivalency\nlast year. She was married when she was a teen-ager. Stand up, Cindy. She\nmarried when she was a teen-ager. She had four children, but she had time\nto serve other people, to get her high school equivalency and she's going\nto use her AmeriCorps money to go back to college.Steven Bishop is the police chief of Kansas City. He's been a national\nleader--stand up Steve. He's been a national leader in using more police\nin community policing and he's worked with AmeriCorps to do it, and the\ncrime rate in Kansas City has gone down as a result of what he did.Cpl. Gregory Depestre went to Haiti as part of his adopted country's force\nto help secure democracy in his native land. And I might add we must be the\nonly country in the world that could have gone to Haiti and taken\nHaitian-Americans there who could speak the language and talk to the\npeople, and he was one of them and we're proud of him.The next two folks I've had the honor of meeting and getting to know a\nlittle bit. The Rev. John and the Rev. Diana Cherry of the A.M.E. Zion\nChurch in Temple Hills, Md. I'd like to ask them to stand. I want to tell\nyou about them. In the early 80's they left Government service and formed a\nchurch in a small living room in a small house in the early 80's. Today\nthat church has 17,000 members. It is one of the three or four biggest\nchurches in the entire United States. It grows by 200 a month.They do it together. And the special focus of their ministry is keeping\nfamilies together. They are--Two things they did make a big impression on\nme. I visited their church once and I learned they were building a new\nsanctuary closer to the Washington, D.C., line, in a higher-crime,\nhigher-drug-rate area because they thought it was part of their ministry to\nchange the lives of the people who needed them. Second thing I want to say\nis that once Reverend Cherry was at a meeting at the White House with some\nother religious leaders and he left early to go back to his church to\nminister to 150 couples that he had brought back to his church from all\nover America to convince them to come back together to save their marriages\nand to raise their kids. This is the kind of work that citizens are doing\nin America. We need more of it and it ought to be lifted up and supported.The last person I want to introduce is Jack Lucas from Hattiesburg,\nMississippi. Jack, would you stand up. Fifty years ago in the sands of Iwo\nJima, Jack Lucas taught and learned the lessons of citizenship. On February\nthe 20th, 1945, he and three of his buddies encountered the enemy and two\ngrenades at their feet. Jack Lucas threw himself on both of them. In that\nmoment he saved the lives of his companions and miraculously in the next\ninstant a medic saved his life. He gained a foothold for freedom and at the\nage of 17, just a year older than his grandson, who's up there with him\ntoday, and his son, who is a West Point graduate and a veteran, at 17, Jack\nLucas became the youngest marine in history and the youngest soldier in\nthis century to win the Congressional Medal of Honor. All these years\nlater, yesterday, here's what he said about that day: Didn't matter where\nyou were from or who you were. You relied on one another. You did it for\nyour country. We all gain when we give and we reap what we sow. That's at\nthe heart of this New Covenant. Responsibility, opportunity and\ncitizenship.More than stale chapters in some remote civic book they're still the virtue\nby which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our God-given potential and be\nlike them. And also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country, the\nenduring dream from that first and most-sacred covenant. I believe every\nperson in this country still believes that we are created equal and given\nby our creator the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.This is a very, very great country and our best days are still to come.\nThank you and God bless you all.",
