    "speech": "MR. SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS:It is a very gratifying privilege to come to the Congress with the Republic\nat peace with all the nations of the world. More, it is equally gratifying\nto report that our country is not only free from every impending, menace of\nwar, but there are growing assurances of the permanency of the peace which\nwe so deeply cherish.For approximately ten years we have dwelt amid menaces of war or as\nparticipants in war's actualities, and the inevitable aftermath, with its\ndisordered conditions, bits added to the difficulties of government which\nadequately can not be appraised except by, those who are in immediate\ncontact and know the responsibilities. Our tasks would be less difficult if\nwe had only ourselves to consider, but so much of the world was involved,\nthe disordered conditions are so well-nigh universal, even among nations\nnot engaged in actual warfare, that no permanent readjustments can be\neffected without consideration of our inescapable relationship to world\naffairs in finance and trade. Indeed, we should be unworthy of our best\ntraditions if we were unmindful of social, moral, and political conditions\nwhich are not of direct concern to us, but which do appeal to the human\nsympathies and the very becoming interest of a people blest with our\nnational good fortune.It is not my purpose to bring to you a program of world restoration. In the\nmain such a program must be worked out by the nations more directly\nconcerned. They must themselves turn to the heroic remedies for the\nmenacing conditions under which they are struggling, then we can help, and\nwe mean to help. We shall do so unselfishly because there is compensation\nin the consciousness of assisting, selfishly because the commerce and\ninternational exchanges in trade, which marked our high tide of fortunate\nadvancement, are possible only when the nations of all continents are\nrestored to stable order and normal relationship.In the main the contribution of this Republic to restored normalcy in the\nworld must come through the initiative of the executive branch of the\nGovernment, but the best of intentions and most carefully considered\npurposes would fail utterly if the sanction and the cooperation of Congress\nwere not cheerfully accorded.I am very sure we shall have no conflict of opinion about constitutional\nduties or authority. During the anxieties of war, when necessity seemed\ncompelling there were excessive grants of authority and all extraordinary\nconcentration of powers in the Chief Executive. The repeal of war-time\nlegislation and the automatic expirations which attended the peace\nproclamations have put an end to these emergency excesses but I have the\nwish to go further than that. I want to join you ill restoring-, ill the\nmost cordial way, the spirit of coordination and cooperation, and that\nmutuality of confidence and respect which is necessary ill representative\npopular government.Encroachment upon the functions of Congress or attempted dictation of its\npolicy are not to be thought of, much less attempted, but there is all\ninsistent call for harmony of purpose and concord of action to speed the\nsolution of the difficult problems confronting both the legislative and\nexecutive branches of the Government.It is worth while to make allusion here to the character of our Clove\nGovernment, mindful as one must be that an address to you is no less it\nmessage to all our people, for whom you speak most intimately. Ours is it\npopular Government through political parties. We divide along political\nlines, and I would ever have it so. I do not mean that partisan preferences\nshould hinder any public servant in the performance of a conscientious and\npatriotic official duty. We saw partisan lines utterly obliterated when war\nimperiled, and our faith in the Republic was riveted anew. We ought not to\nfind these partisan lines obstructing the expeditious solution of the\nurgent problems of peace.Granting that we are fundamentally a representative popular Government,\nwith political parties the governing agencies, I believe the political\nparty in power should assume responsibility, determine upon policies ill\nthe conference which supplements conventions and election campaigns, and\nthen strive for achievement through adherence to the accepted policy.There is vastly greater security, immensely more of the national\nviewpoint, much larger and prompter accomplishment where our divisions are\nalong party lines, in the broader and loftier sense, than to divide\ngeographically, or according to pursuits, or personal following. For a\ncentury and a third, parties have been charged with responsibility and held\nto strict accounting. When they fail, they are relieved of authority; and\nthe system has brought its to a national eminence no less than a world\nexample.Necessarily legislation is a matter of compromise. The full ideal is seldom\nattained. In that meeting of minds necessary to insure results, there must\nand will be accommodations and compromises, but in the estimate of\nconvictions and sincere put-poses the supreme responsibility to national\ninterest must not be ignored. The shield to the high-minded public servant\nwho adheres to party policy is manifest, but the higher purpose is the good\nof the Republic as a whole.It would be ungracious to withhold acknowledgment of the really large\nvolume and excellent quality of work accomplished by the extraordinary\nsession of Congress which so recently adjourned. I am not unmindful of the\nvery difficult tasks with which you were called to deal, and no one can\nignore the insistent conditions which, during recent years, have called for\nthe continued and almost exclusive attention of your membership to public\nwork. It would suggest insincerity if I expressed complete accord with\nevery expression recorded in your roll calls, but we are all agreed about\nthe difficulties and the inevitable divergence of opinion in seeking the\nreduction, amelioration and readjustment of the burdens of taxation. Later\non, when other problems are solved, I shall make some recommendations about\nrenewed consideration of our tax program, but for the immediate time before\nus we must be content with the billion dollar reduction in the tax draft\nupon the people, and diminished irritations, banished uncertainty and\nimproved methods of collection. By your sustainment of the rigid economies\nalready inaugurated, with hoped-for extension of these economies and added\nefficiencies in administration, I believe further reductions may be enacted\nand hindering burdens abolished.In these urgent economies we shall be immensely assisted by the budget\nsystem for which you made provision in the extraordinary session. The first\nbudget is before you. Its preparation is a signal achievement, and the\nperfection of the system, a thing impossible in the few months available\nfor its initial trial, will mark its enactment as the beginning of the\ngreatest reformation in governmental practices since the beginning of the\nRepublic.There is pending a grant of authority to the administrative branch of the\nGovernment for the funding and settlement of our vast foreign loans growing\nout of our grant of war credits. With the hands of the executive branch\nheld impotent to deal with these debts we are hindering urgent\nreadjustments among our debtors and accomplishing nothing for ourselves. I\nthink it is fair for the Congress to assume that the executive branch of\nthe Government would adopt no major policy in dealing with these matters\nwhich would conflict with the purpose of Congress in authorizing the loans,\ncertainly not without asking congressional approval, but there are minor\nproblems incident to prudent loan transactions and the safeguarding of our\ninterests which can not even be attempted without this authorization. It\nwill be helpful to ourselves and it will improve conditions among our\ndebtors if funding and the settlement of defaulted interest may be\nnegotiated.The previous Congress, deeply concerned in behalf of our merchant marine,\nin 1920 enacted the existing shipping law, designed for the upbuilding of\nthe American merchant marine. Among other things provided to encourage our\nshipping on the world's seas, the Executive was directed to give notice of\nthe termination of all existing commercial treaties in order to admit of\nreduced duties on imports carried in American bottoms. During the life of\nthe act no Executive has complied with this order of the Congress. When the\npresent administration came into responsibility it began an early inquiry\ninto the failure to execute the expressed purpose of the Jones Act. Only\none conclusion has been possible. Frankly, Members of House and Senate,\neager its I am to join you in the making of an American merchant marine\ncommensurate with our commerce, the denouncement of our commercial\ntreaties would involve us in a chaos of trade relationships and add\nindescribably to the confusion of the already disordered commercial world.\nOur power to do so is not disputed, but power and ships, without comity of\nrelationship, will not give us the expanded trade which is inseparably\nlinked with a great merchant marine. Moreover, the applied reduction of\nduty, for which the treaty denouncements were necessary, encouraged only\nthe carrying of dutiable imports to our shores, while the tonnage which\nunfurls the flag on the seas is both free and dutiable, and the cargoes\nwhich make it nation eminent in trade are outgoing, rather than incoming.It is not my thought to lay the problem before you in detail today. It is\ndesired only to say to you that the executive branch of the Government,\nuninfluenced by the protest of any nation, for none has been made, is well\nconvinced that your proposal, highly intended and heartily supported here,\nis so fraught with difficulties and so marked by tendencies to discourage\ntrade expansion, that I invite your tolerance of noncompliance for only a\nfew weeks until a plan may be presented which contemplates no greater draft\nupon the Public Treasury, and which, though yet too crude to offer it\nto-day, gives such promise of expanding our merchant marine, that it will\nargue its own approval. It is enough to say to-day that we are so possessed\nof ships, and the American intention to establish it merchant marine is so\nunalterable, that a plain of reimbursement, at no other cost than is\ncontemplated in the existing act, will appeal to the pride and encourage\nthe hope of all the American people.There is before you the completion of the enactment of what has been termed\na \"permanent\" tariff law, the word \"permanent\" being used to distinguish\nit from the emergency act which the Congress expedited early in the\nextraordinary session, and which is the law today. I can not too strongly\nurge in early completion of this necessary legislation It is needed to\nstabilize our industry at home; it is essential to make more definite our\ntrade relations abroad. More, it is vital to the preservation of many of\nour own industries which contribute so notably to the very lifeblood of our\nNation.There is now, and there always will be, a storm of conflicting opinion\nabout any tariff revision. We can not go far wrong when we base our tariffs\non the policy of preserving the productive activities which enhance\nemployment and add to our national prosperity.Again comes the reminder that we must not be unmindful of world conditions,\nthat peoples are struggling for industrial rehabilitation and that we can\nnot dwell in industrial and commercial exclusion and at the same time do\nthe just thing in aiding world reconstruction and readjustment. We do not\nseek a selfish aloofness, and we could not profit by it, were it possible.\nWe recognize the necessity of buying wherever we sell, and the permanency\nof trade lies in its acceptable exchanges. In our pursuit of markets we\nmust give as well as receive. We can not sell to others who do not produce,\nnor can we buy unless we produce at home. Sensible of every obligation of\nhumanity, commerce and finance, linked as they are in the present world\ncondition, it is not to be argued that we need destroy ourselves to be\nhelpful to others. With all my heart I wish restoration to the peoples\nblighted by the awful World War, but the process of restoration does not\nlie in our acceptance of like conditions. It were better to, remain on firm\nground, strive for ample employment and high standards of wage at home, and\npoint the way to balanced budgets, rigid economies, and resolute, efficient\nwork as the necessary remedies to cure disaster.Everything relating to trade, among ourselves and among nations, has been\nexpanded, excessive, inflated, abnormal, and there is a madness in finance\nwhich no American policy alone will cure. We are a creditor Nation, not by\nnormal processes, but made so by war. It is not an unworthy selfishness to\nseek to save ourselves, when the processes of that salvation are not only\nnot denied to others, but commended to them. We seek to undermine for\nothers no industry by which they subsist; we are obligated to permit the\nundermining of none of our own which make for employment and maintained\nactivities.Every contemplation, it little matters in which direction one turns,\nmagnifies the difficulty of tariff legislation, but the necessity of the\nrevision is magnified with it. Doubtless we are justified in seeking it.\nMore flexible policy than we have provided heretofore. I hope a way will be\nfound to make for flexibility and elasticity, so that rates may be adjusted\nto meet unusual and changing conditions which can not be accurately\nanticipated. There are problems incident to unfair practices, and to\nexchanges which madness in money have made almost unsolvable. I know of no\nmanner in which to effect this flexibility other than the extension of the\npowers of the Tariff Commission so that it can adapt itself to it\nscientific and wholly just administration of the law.I am not unmindful of the constitutional difficulties. These can be met by\ngiving authority to the Chief Executive, who could proclaim-additional\nduties to meet conditions which the Congress may designate.At this point I must disavow any desire to enlarge the Executive's powers\nor add to the responsibilities of the office. They are already too large.\nIf there were any other plan I would prefer it.The grant of authority to proclaim would necessarily bring the Tariff\nCommission into new and enlarged activities, because no Executive could\ndischarge such a duty except upon the information acquired and\nrecommendations made by this commission. But the plan is feasible, and the\nproper functioning of the board would give its it better administration of\na defined policy than ever can be made possible by tariff duties prescribed\nwithout flexibility.There is a manifest difference of opinion about the merits of American\nvaluation. Many nations have adopted delivery valuation as the basis for\ncollecting duties; that is, they take the cost of the imports delivered at\nthe port of entry as the basis for levying duty. It is no radical\ndeparture, in view of varying conditions and the disordered state of money\nvalues, to provide for American valuation, but there can not be ignored the\ndanger of such a valuation, brought to the level of our own production\ncosts, making our tariffs prohibitive. It might do so in many instances\nwhere imports ought to be encouraged. I believe Congress ought well\nconsider the desirability of the only promising alternative, namely, a\nprovision authorizing proclaimed American valuation, under prescribed\nconditions, on any given list of articles imported.In this proposed flexibility, authorizing increases to meet conditions so\nlikely to change, there should also be provision for decreases. A rate may\nbe just to-day, and entirely out of proportion six months from to-day. If\nour tariffs are to be made equitable, and not necessarily burden our\nimports and hinder our trade abroad, frequent adjustment will be necessary\nfor years to come. Knowing the impossibility of modification by act of\nCongress for any one or a score of lines without involving a long array of\nschedules, I think we shall go a long ways toward stabilization, if there\nis recognition of the Tariff Commission's fitness to recommend urgent\nchanges by proclamation.I am sure about public opinion favoring the early determination of our\ntariff policy. There have been reassuring signs of a business revival from\nthe deep slump which all the world has been experiencing. Our unemployment,\nwhich gave its deep concern only a few weeks ago, has grown encouragingly\nless, and new assurances and renewed confidence will attend the\ncongressional declaration that American industry will be held secure.Much has been said about the protective policy for ourselves making it\nimpossible for our debtors to discharge their obligations to us. This is a\ncontention not now pressing for decision. If we must choose between a\npeople in idleness pressing for the payment of indebtedness, or a people\nresuming the normal ways of employment and carrying the credit, let us\nchoose the latter. Sometimes we appraise largest the human ill most vivid\nin our minds. We have been giving, and are giving now, of our influence and\nappeals to minimize the likelihood of war and throw off the crushing\nburdens of armament. It is all very earnest, with a national soul\nimpelling. But a people unemployed, and gaunt with hunger, face a situation\nquite as disheartening as war, and our greater obligation to-day is to do\nthe Government's part toward resuming productivity and promoting fortunate\nand remunerative employment.Something more than tariff protection is required by American agriculture.\nTo the farmer has come the earlier and the heavier burdens of readjustment.\nThere is actual depression in our agricultural industry, while agricultural\nprosperity is absolutely essential to the general prosperity of the\ncountry.Congress has sought very earnestly to provide relief. It has promptly given\nsuch temporary relief as has been possible, but the call is insistent for\nthe permanent solution. It is inevitable that large crops lower the prices\nand short crops advance them. No legislation can cure that fundamental law.\nBut there must be some economic solution for the excessive variation in\nreturns for agricultural production.It is rather shocking to be told, and to have the statement strongly\nsupported, that 9,000,000 bales of cotton, raised on American plantations\nin a given year, will actually be worth more to the producers than\n13,000,000 bales would have been. Equally shocking is the statement that\n700,000,000 bushels of wheat, raised by American farmers, would bring them\nmore money than a billion bushels. Yet these are not exaggerated\nstatements. In a world where there are tens of millions who need food and\nclothing which they can not get, such a condition is sure to indict the\nsocial system which makes it possible.In the main the remedy lies in distribution and marketing. Every proper\nencouragement should be given to the cooperative marketing programs. These\nhave proven very helpful to the cooperating communities in Europe. In\nRussia the cooperative community has become the recognized bulwark of law\nand order, and saved individualism from engulfment in social paralysis.\nUltimately they will be accredited with the salvation of the Russian\nState.There is the appeal for this experiment. Why not try it? No one challenges\nthe right of the farmer to a larger share of the consumer's pay for his\nproduct, no one disputes that we can not live without the farmer. He is\njustified in rebelling against the transportation cost. Given a fair\nreturn for his labor, he will have less occasion to appeal for financial\naid; and given assurance that his labors shall not be in vain, we reassure\nall the people of a production sufficient to meet our National requirement\nand guard against disaster.The base of the pyramid of civilization which rests upon the soil is\nshrinking through the drift of population from farm to city. For a\ngeneration we have been expressing more or less concern about this\ntendency. Economists have warned and statesmen have deplored. We thought\nfor at time that modern conveniences and the more intimate contact would\nhalt the movement, but it has gone steadily on. Perhaps only grim necessity\nwill correct it, but we ought to find a less drastic remedy.The existing scheme of adjusting freight rates hits been favoring the\nbasing points, until industries are attracted to some centers and repelled\nfrom others. A great volume of uneconomic and wasteful transportation has\nattended, and the cost increased accordingly. The grain-milling and\nmeat-packing industries afford ample illustration, and the attending\nconcentration is readily apparent. The menaces in concentration are not\nlimited to the retardingly influences on agriculture. Manifestly the.\nconditions and terms of railway transportation ought not be permitted to\nincrease this undesirable tendency. We have a just pride in our great\ncities, but we shall find a greater pride in the Nation, which has it\nlarger distribution of its population into the country, where comparatively\nself-sufficient smaller communities may blend agricultural and\nmanufacturing interests in harmonious helpfulness and enhanced good\nfortune. Such a movement contemplates no destruction of things wrought, of\ninvestments made, or wealth involved. It only looks to a general policy of\ntransportation of distributed industry, and of highway construction, to\nencourage the spread of our population and restore the proper balance\nbetween city and country. The problem may well have your earnest\nattention.It has been perhaps the proudest claim of our American civilization that in\ndealing with human relationships it has constantly moved toward such\njustice in distributing the product of human energy that it has improved\ncontinuously the economic status of the mass of people. Ours has been a\nhighly productive social organization. On the way up from the elemental\nstages of society we have eliminated slavery and serfdom and are now far on\nthe way to the elimination of poverty.Through the eradication of illiteracy and the diffusion of education\nmankind has reached a stage where we may fairly say that in the United\nStates equality of opportunity has been attained, though all are not\nprepared to embrace it. There is, indeed, a too great divergence between\nthe economic conditions of the most and the least favored classes in the\ncommunity. But even that divergence has now come to the point where we\nbracket the very poor and the very rich together as the least fortunate\nclasses. Our efforts may well be directed to improving the status of both.While this set of problems is commonly comprehended under the general\nphrase \"Capital and labor,\" it is really vastly broader. It is a question\nof social and economic organization. Labor has become a large contributor,\nthrough its savings, to the stock of capital; while the people who own the\nlargest individual aggregates of capital are themselves often hard and\nearnest laborers. Very often it is extremely difficult to draw the line of\ndemarcation between the two groups; to determine whether a particular\nindividual is entitled to be set down as laborer or as capitalist. In a\nvery large proportion of cases he is both, and when he is both he is the\nmost useful citizen.The right of labor to organize is just as fundamental and necessary as is\nthe right of capital to organize. The right of labor to negotiate, to deal\nwith and solve its particular problems in an organized way, through its\nchosen agents, is just as essential as is the right of capital to organize,\nto maintain corporations, to limit the liabilities of stockholders. Indeed,\nwe have come to recognize that the limited liability of the citizen as a\nmember of a labor organization closely parallels the limitation of\nliability of the citizen as a stockholder in a corporation for profit.\nAlong this line of reasoning we shall make the greatest progress toward\nsolution of our problem of capital and labor.In the case of the corporation which enjoys the privilege of limited\nliability of stockholders, particularly when engaged in in the public\nservice, it is recognized that the outside public has a large concern\nwhich must be protected; and so we provide regulations, restrictions, and\nin some cases detailed supervision. Likewise in the case of labor\norganizations, we might well apply similar and equally well-defined\nprinciples of regulation and supervision in order to conserve the public's\ninterests as affected by their operations.Just as it is not desirable that a corporation shall be allowed to impose\nundue exactions upon the public, so it is not desirable that a labor\norganization shall be permitted to exact unfair terms of employment or\nsubject the public to actual distresses in order to enforce its terms.\nFinally, just as we are earnestly seeking for procedures whereby to adjust\nand settle political differences between nations without resort to war, so\nwe may well look about for means to settle the differences between\norganized capital and organized labor without resort to those forms of\nwarfare which we recognize under the name of strikes, lockouts, boycotts,\nand the like.As we have great bodies of law carefully regulating the organization and\noperations of industrial and financial corporations, as we have treaties\nand compacts among nations which look to the settlement of differences\nwithout the necessity of conflict in arms, so we might well have plans of\nconference, of common counsel, of mediation, arbitration, and judicial\ndetermination in controversies between labor and capital. To accomplish\nthis would involve the necessity to develop a thoroughgoing code of\npractice in dealing with such affairs It might be well to frankly set forth\nthe superior interest of the community as a whole to either the labor group\nor the capital group. With rights, privileges, immunities, and modes of\norganization thus carefully defined, it should be possible to set up\njudicial or quasi judicial tribunals for the consideration and\ndetermination of all disputes which menace the public welfare.In an industrial society such as ours the strike, the lockout, and the\nboycott are as much out of place and as disastrous in their results as is\nwar or armed revolution in the domain of politics. The same disposition to\nreasonableness, to conciliation, to recognition of the other side's point\nof view, the same provision of fair and recognized tribunals and processes,\nought to make it possible to solve the one set of questions its easily as\nthe other. I believe the solution is possible.The consideration of such a policy would necessitate the exercise of care\nand deliberation in the construction of a code and a charter of elemental\nrights, dealing with the relations of employer and employee. This\nfoundation in the law, dealing with the modern conditions of social and\neconomic life, would hasten the building of the temple of peace in industry\nwhich a rejoicing nation would acclaim.After each war, until the last, the Government has been enabled to give\nhomes to its returned soldiers, and a large part of our settlement and\ndevelopment has attended this generous provision of land for the Nation's\ndefenders.There is yet unreserved approximately 200,000,000 acres in the public\ndomain, 20,000,000 acres of which are known to be susceptible of\nreclamation and made fit for homes by provision for irrigation.The Government has been assisting in the development of its remaining\nlands, until the estimated increase in land values in the irrigated\nsections is full $500,000,000 and the crops of 1920 alone on these lands\nare estimated to exceed $100,000,000. Under the law authorization these\nexpenditures for development the advances are to be returned and it would\nbe good business for the Government to provide for the reclamation of the\nremaining 20,000,000 acres, in addition to expediting the completion of\nprojects long under way.Under what is known as the coal and gas lease law, applicable also to\ndeposits of phosphates and other minerals on the public domain, leases are\nnow being made on the royalty basis, and are producing large revenues to\nthe Government. Under this legislation, 10 per centum of all royalties is\nto be paid directly to the Federal Treasury, and of the remainder 50 per\ncentum is to be used for reclamation of arid lands by irrigation, and 40\nper centum is to be paid to the States, in which the operations are\nlocated, to be used by them for school and road purposes.These resources are so vast, and the development is affording so reliable a\nbasis of estimate, that the Interior Department expresses the belief that\nultimately the present law will add in royalties and payments to the\ntreasuries of the Federal Government and the States containing these public\nlands a total of $12,000,000,000. This means, of course, an added wealth of\nmany times that sum. These prospects seem to afford every justification of\nGovernment advances in reclamation and irrigation.Contemplating the inevitable and desirable increase of population, there is\nanother phase of reclamation full worthy of consideration. There are\n79,000,000 acres of swamp and cut-over lands which may be reclaimed and\nmade as valuable as any farm lands we possess. These acres are largely\nlocated in Southern States, and the greater proportion is owned by the\nStates or by private citizens. Congress has a report of the survey of this\nfield for reclamation, and the feasibility is established. I gladly commend\nFederal aid, by way of advances, where State and private participation is\nassured.Home making is one of the greater benefits which government can bestow.\nMeasures are pending embodying this sound policy to which we may well\nadhere. It is easily possible to make available permanent homes which will\nprovide, in turn, for prosperous American families, without injurious\ncompetition with established activities, or imposition on wealth already\nacquired.While we are thinking of promoting the fortunes of our own people I am sure\nthere is room in the sympathetic thought of America for fellow human beings\nwho are suffering and dying of starvation in Russia. A severe drought in\nthe Valley of the Volga has plunged 15,000,000 people into grievous famine.\nOur voluntary agencies are exerting themselves to the utmost to save the\nlives of children in this area, but it is now evident that unless relief is\nafforded the loss of life will extend into many millions. America can not\nbe deaf to such a call as that.We do not recognize the government of Russia, nor tolerate the propaganda\nwhich emanates therefrom, but we do not forget the traditions of Russian\nfriendship. We may put aside our consideration of all international\npolitics and fundamental differences in government. The big thing is the\ncall of the suffering and the dying. Unreservedly I recommend the\nappropriation necessary to supply the American Relief Administration with\n10,000,000 bushels of corn and 1,000,000 bushels of seed grains, not alone\nto halt the wave of death through starvation, but to enable spring planting\nin areas where the seed grains have been exhausted temporarily to stem\nstarvation.The American Relief Administration is directed in Russia by former officers\nof our own armies, and has fully demonstrated its ability to transport and\ndistribute relief through American hands without hindrance or loss. The\ntime has come to add the Government's support to the wonderful relief\nalready wrought out of the generosity of the American private purse.I am not unaware that we have suffering and privation at home. When it\nexceeds the capacity for the relief within the States concerned, it will\nhave Federal consideration. It seems to me we should be indifferent to our\nown heart promptings, and out of accord with the spirit which acclaims the\nChristmastide, if we do not give out of our national abundance to lighten\nthis burden of woe upon a people blameless and helpless in famine's peril.There are it full score of topics concerning which it would be becoming to\naddress you, and on which I hope to make report at a later time. I have\nalluded to the things requiring your earlier attention. However, I can not\nend this limited address without a suggested amendment to the organic law.Many of us belong to that school of thought which is hesitant about\naltering the fundamental law. I think our tax problems, the tendency of\nwealth to seek nontaxable investment, and the menacing increase of public\ndebt, Federal, State and municipal-all justify a proposal to change the\nConstitution so as to end the issue of nontaxable bonds. No action can\nchange the status of the many billions outstanding, but we can guard\nagainst future encouragement of capital's paralysis, while a halt in the\ngrowth of public indebtedness would be beneficial throughout our whole\nland.Such a change in the Constitution must be very thoroughly considered before\nsubmission. There ought to be known what influence it will have on the\ninevitable refunding of our vast national debt, how it will operate on the\nnecessary refunding of State and municipal debt, how the advantages of\nNation over State and municipality, or the contrary, may be avoided.\nClearly the States would not ratify to their own apparent disadvantage. I\nsuggest the consideration because the drift of wealth into nontaxable\nsecurities is hindering the flow of large capital to our industries,\nmanufacturing, agricultural, and carrying, until we are discouraging the\nvery activities which make our wealth.Agreeable to your expressed desire and in complete accord with the purposes\nof the executive branch of the Government, there is in Washington, as you\nhappily know, an International Conference now most earnestly at work on\nplans for the limitation of armament, a naval holiday, and the just\nsettlement of problems which might develop into causes of international\ndisagreement.It is easy to believe a world-hope is centered on this Capital City. A most\ngratifying world-accomplishment is not improbable.",
