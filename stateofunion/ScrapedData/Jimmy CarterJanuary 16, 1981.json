    "speech": "To the Congress of the United States:The State of the Union is sound. Our economy is recovering from a\nrecession. A national energy plan is in place and our dependence on foreign\noil is decreasing. We have been at peace for four uninterrupted years.But, our Nation has serious problems. Inflation and unemployment are\nunacceptably high. The world oil market is increasingly tight. There are\ntrouble spots throughout the world, and 52 American hostages are being held\nin Iran against international law and against every precept of human\naffairs.However, I firmly believe that, as a result of the progress made in so many\ndomestic and international areas over the past four years, our Nation is\nstronger, wealthier, more compassionate and freer than it was four years\nago. I am proud of that fact. And I believe the Congress should be proud as\nwell, for so much of what has been accomplished over the past four years\nhas been due to the hard work, insights and cooperation of Congress. I\napplaud the Congress for its efforts and its achievements.In this State of the Union Message I want to recount the achievements and\nprogress of the last four years and to offer recommendations to the\nCongress for this year. While my term as President will end before the 97th\nCongress begins its work in earnest, I hope that my recommendations will\nserve as a guide for the direction this country should take so we build on\nthe record of the past four years.RECORD OF PROGRESSWhen I took office, our Nation faced a number of serious domestic and\ninternational problems:--no national energy policy existed, and our dependence on foreign oil was\nrapidly increasing;--public trust in the integrity and openness of the government was low;--the Federal government was operating inefficiently in administering\nessential programs and policies;--major social problems were being ignored or poorly addressed by the\nFederal government;--our defense posture was declining as a result of a defense budget which\nwas continuously shrinking in real terms;--the strength of the NATO Alliance needed to be bolstered;--tensions between Israel and Egypt threatened another Middle East war;\nand--America's resolve to oppose human rights violations was under serious\nquestion.Over the past 48 months, clear progress has been made in solving the\nchallenges we found in January of 1977:--almost all of our comprehensive energy program have been enacted, and the\nDepartment of Energy has been established to administer the program;\nconfidence in the government's integrity has been restored, and respect for\nthe government's openness and fairness has been renewed;--the government has been made more effective and efficient: the Civil\nService system was completely reformed for the first time this century;--14 reorganization initiatives have been proposed to the Congress,\napproved, and implemented;--two new Cabinet departments have been created to consolidate and\nstreamline the government's handling of energy and education problems;--inspectors general have been placed in each Cabinet department to combat\nfraud, waste and other abuses;--the regulatory process has been reformed through creation of the\nRegulatory Council, implementation of Executive Order 12044 and its\nrequirement for cost-impact analyses, elimination of unnecessary\nregulation, and passage of the Regulatory Flexibility Act;--procedures have been established to assure citizen participation in\ngovernment;--and the airline, trucking, rail and communications industries are being\nderegulated;--critical social problems, many long ignored by the Federal government,\nhave been addressed directly;--an urban policy was developed and implemented to reverse the decline\nin our urban areas;--the Social Security System was refinanced to put it on a sound financial\nbasis;--the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act was enacted;--Federal assistance for education was expanded by more than 75 percent;--the minimum wage was increased to levels needed to ease the effects of\ninflation;--affirmative action has been pursued aggressively; more blacks, Hispanics\nand women have been appointed to senior government positions and to\njudgeships than at any other time in our history;--the ERA ratification deadline was extended to aid the ratification effort;--and minority business procurement by the Federal government has more than\ndoubled;--the Nation's first sectoral policies were put in place, for the auto and\nsteel industries, with my Administration demonstrating the value of\ncooperation between the government, business and labor;--reversing previous trends, real defense spending has increased every year\nsince 1977;--the real increase in FY 1980 defense spending is well above 3 percent\nand I expect FY 1981 defense spending to be even higher;--looking ahead, the defense program I am proposing is premised on a real\nincrease in defense spending over the next five years of 20 percent or\nmore;--the NATO Alliance has proven its unity in responding to the situations in\nEastern Europe and Southwest Asia and in agreeing on the issues to be\naddressed in the review of the Helsinki Final Act currently underway in\nMadrid;--the peace process in the Middle East established at Camp David and by the\nPeace Treaty between Egypt and Israel is being buttressed on two fronts:\nsteady progress in the normalization of Egyptian-Israeli relations in many\nfields, and the commitment of both Egypt and Israel, with United States'\nassistance, to see through to successful conclusion the autonomy\nnegotiations for the West Bank and Gaza;--the Panama Canal Treaties have been put into effect, which has helped to\nimprove relations with Latin America;--we have continued this Nation's strong commitment to the pursuit of human\nrights throughout the world, evenhandedly and objectively;--our commitment to a worldwide human rights policy has remained firm;--and many other countries have given high priority to it;--our resolve to oppose aggression, such as the illegal invasion of the\nSoviet Union into Afghanistan, has been supported by tough action.I. ENSURING ECONOMIC STRENGTH ECONOMYDuring the last decade our Nation has withstood a series of economic shocks\nunprecedented in peacetime. The most dramatic of these has been the\nexplosive increases of OPEC oil prices. But we have also faced world\ncommodity shortages, natural disasters, agricultural shortages and major\nchallenges to world peace and security. Our ability to deal with these\nshocks has been impaired because of a decrease in the growth of\nproductivity and the persistence of underlying inflationary forces built up\nover the past 15 years.Nevertheless, the economy has proved to be remarkably resilient. Real\noutput has grown at an average rate of 3 percent per year since I took\noffice, and employment has grown by 10 percent. We have added about 8\nmillion productive private sector jobs to the economy. However,\nunacceptably high inflation--the most difficult economic problem I have\nfaced--persists.This inflation--which threatens the growth, productivity, and stability of\nour economy--requires that we restrain the growth of the budget to the\nmaximum extent consistent with national security and human compassion. I\nhave done so in my earlier budgets, and in my FY '82 budget. However, while\nrestraint is essential to any appropriate economic policy, high inflation\ncannot be attributed solely to government spending. The growth in budget\noutlays has been more the result of economic factors than the cause of\nthem.We are now in the early stages of economic recovery following a short\nrecession. Typically, a post-recessionary period has been marked by\nvigorous economic growth aided by anti-recessionary policy measures such as\nlarge tax cuts or big, stimulation spending programs. I have declined to\nrecommend such actions to stimulate economic activity, because the\npersistent inflationary pressures that beset our economy today dictate a\nrestrained fiscal policy.Accordingly, I am asking the Congress to postpone until January 1, 1982,\nthe personal tax reductions I had earlier proposed to take effect on\nJanuary 1 of this year.However, my 1982 budget proposes significant tax changes to increase the\nsources of financing for business investment. While emphasizing the need\nfor continued fiscal restraint, this budget takes the first major step in a\nlong-term tax reduction program designed to increase capital formation. The\nfailure of our Nation's capital stock to grow at a rate that keeps pace\nwith its labor force has clearly been one cause of our productivity\nslowdown. Higher investment rates are also critically needed to meet our\nNation's energy needs, and to replace energy-inefficient plants and\nequipment with new energy-saving physical plants. The level of investment\nthat is called for will not occur in the absence of policies to encourage\nit.Therefore, my budget proposes a major liberalization of tax allowances for\ndepreciation, as well as simplified depreciation accounting, increasing the\nallowable rates by about 40 percent. I am also proposing improvements in\nthe investment tax credit, making it refundable, to meet the investment\nneeds of firms with no current earnings.These two proposals, along with carefully-phased tax reductions for\nindividuals, will improve both economic efficiency and tax equity. I urge\nthe Congress to enact legislation along the lines and timetable I have\nproposed.THE 1982 BUDGETThe FY 1982 budget I have sent to the Congress continues our four-year\npolicy of prudence and restraint. While the budget deficits during my term\nare higher than I would have liked, their size is determined for the most\npart by economic conditions. And in spite of these conditions, the relative\nsize of the deficit continues to decline. In 1976, before I took office,\nthe budget deficit equalled 4 percent of gross national product. It had\nbeen cut to 2.3 percent in the 1980 fiscal year just ended. My 1982 budget\ncontains a deficit estimated to be less than 1 percent of our gross\nnational product.The rate of growth in Federal spending has been held to a minimum.\nNevertheless, outlays are still rising more rapidly than many had\nanticipated, the result of many powerful forces in our society:We face a threat to our security, as events in Afghanistan, the Middle\nEast, and Eastern Europe make clear. We have a steadily aging population\nand, as a result, the biggest single increase in the Federal budget is the\nrising cost of retirement programs, particularly social security. We face\nother important domestic needs: to continue responsibility for the\ndisadvantaged; to provide the capital needed by our cities and our\ntransportation systems; to protect our environment; to revitalize American\nindustry; and to increase the export of American goods and services so\nessential to the creation of jobs and a trade surplus.Yet the Federal Government itself may not always be the proper source of\nsuch assistance. For example, it must not usurp functions if they can be\nmore appropriately decided upon, managed, and financed by the private\nsector or by State and local governments. My Administration has always\nsought to consider the proper focus of responsibility for the most\nefficient resolution of problems.We have also recognized the need to simplify the system of grants to State\nand local governments. I have again proposed several grant consolidations\nin the 1982 budget, including a new proposal that would consolidate several\nhighway programs.The pressures for growth in Federal use of national resources are great. My\nAdministration has initiated many new approaches to cope with these\npressures. We started a multi-year budget system, and we began a system for\ncontrolling Federal credit programs. Yet in spite of increasing needs to\nlimit spending growth, we have consistently adhered to these strong budget\nprinciples:Our Nation's armed forces must always stand sufficiently strong to deter\naggression and to assure our security. An effective national energy plan is\nessential to increase domestic production of oil and gas, to encourage\nconservation of our scarce energy resources, to stimulate conversion to\nmore abundant fuels, and to reduce our trade deficit. The essential human\nneeds for our citizens must be given the highest priority. The Federal\nGovernment must lead the way in investment in the Nation's technological\nfuture. The Federal Government has an obligation to nurture and protect our\nenvironment--the common resource, birthright, and sustenance of the\nAmerican people.My 1982 budget continues to support these principles. It also proposes\nresponsible tax reductions to encourage a more productive economy, and\nadequate funding of our highest priority programs within an overall policy\nof constraint.Fiscal restraint must be continued in the years ahead. Budgets must be\ntight enough to convince those who set wages and prices that the Federal\nGovernment is serious about fighting inflation but not so tight as to choke\noff all growth.Careful budget policy should be supplemented by other measures designed to\nreduce inflation at lower cost in lost output and employment. These other\nsteps include measures to increase investment--such as the tax proposals\nincluded in my 1982 budget--and measures to increase competition and\nproductivity in our economy. Voluntary incomes policies can also directly\ninfluence wages and prices in the direction of moderation and thereby bring\ninflation down faster and at lower cost to the economy. Through a tax-based\nincomes policy (TIP) we could provide tax incentives for firms and workers\nto moderate their wage and price increases. In the coming years, control of\nFederal expenditures can make possible periodic tax reductions. The\nCongress should therefore begin now to evaluate the potentialities of a TIP\nprogram so that when the next round of tax reductions is appropriate a TIP\nprogram will be seriously considered.EMPLOYMENTDuring the last four years we have given top priority to meeting the needs\nof workers and providing additional job opportunities to those who seek\nwork. Since the end of 1976:Almost 9 million new jobs have been added to the nation's economy total\nemployment has reached 97 million. More jobs than ever before are held by\nwomen, minorities and young people. Employment over the past four years has\nincreased by: 17% for adult women 11% for blacks, and 30% for Hispanics\nemployment of black teenagers increased by more than 5%, reversing the\ndecline that occurred in the previous eight years.Major initiatives launched by this Administration helped bring about these\naccomplishments and have provided a solid foundation for employment and\ntraining policy in the 1980's. In 1977, as part of the comprehensive\neconomic stimulus program:425,000 public service jobs were created A $1 billion youth employment\ninitiative funded 200,000 jobs the doubling of the Job Corps to 44,000\nslots began and 1 million summer youth jobs were approved--a 25 percent\nincrease.In 1978:The Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act became law the $400 million\nPrivate Sector Initiatives Program was begun a targeted jobs tax credit for\ndisadvantaged youth and others with special employment barriers was enacted\nthe Comprehensive Employment and Training Act was reauthorized for four\nyears.In 1979:A $6 billion welfare reform proposal was introduced with funding for\n400,000 public service jobs welfare reform demonstration projects were\nlaunched in communities around the country the Vice President initiated a\nnationwide review of youth unemployment in this country.In 1980:The findings of the Vice President's Task Force revealed the major\neducation and employment deficits that exist for poor and minority\nyoungsters. As a result a $2 billion youth education and jobs initiative\nwas introduced to provide unemployed youth with the basic education and\nwork experience they need to compete in the labor market of the 1980's. As\npart of the economic revitalization program several steps were proposed to\naid workers in high unemployment communities:An additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits for the long term\nunemployed. $600 million to train the disadvantaged and unemployed for new\nprivate sector jobs. Positive adjustment demonstrations to aid workers in\ndeclining industries. The important Title VII Private Sector Initiatives\nProgram was reauthorized for an additional two years.In addition to making significant progress in helping the disadvantaged and\nunemployed, important gains were realized for all workers:An historic national accord with organized labor made it possible for the\nviews of working men and women to be heard as the nation's economic and\ndomestic policies were formulated; the Mine Safety and Health Act brought\nabout improved working conditions for the nation's 500,000 miners.\nsubstantial reforms of Occupational Safety and Health Administration were\naccomplished to help reduce unnecessary burdens on business and to focus on\nmajor health and safety problems; the minimum wage was increased over a\nfour year period from $2.30 to $3.35 an hour; the Black Lung Benefit Reform\nAct was signed into law; attempts to weaken Davis-Bacon Act were defeated.While substantial gains have been made in the last four years, continued\nefforts are required to ensure that this progress is continued:Government must continue to make labor a full partner in the policy\ndecisions that affect the interests of working men and women; a broad,\nbipartisan effort to combat youth unemployment must be sustained\ncompassionate reform of the nation's welfare system should be continued\nwith employment opportunities provided for those able to work; workers in\ndeclining industries should be provided new skills and help in finding\nemployment.TRADEOver the past year, the U.S. trade picture improved as a result of solid\nexport gains in both manufactured and agricultural products. Agricultural\nexports reached a new record of over $40 billion, while manufactured\nexports have grown by 24 percent to a record $144 billion. In these areas\nthe United States recorded significant surpluses of $24 billion and $19\nbillion respectively. While our oil imports remained a major drain on our\nforeign exchange earnings, that drain was somewhat moderated by a 19\npercent decline in the volume of oil imports.U.S. trade negotiators made significant progress over the past year in\nassuring effective implementation of the agreements negotiated during the\nTokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. Agreements reached with the\nJapanese government, for example, will assure that the United States will\nbe able to expand its exports to the Japanese market in such key areas as\ntelecommunications equipment, tobacco, and lumber. Efforts by U.S. trade\nnegotiators also helped to persuade a number of key developing countries to\naccept many of the non-tariff codes negotiated during the Multilateral\nTrade Negotiations. This will assure that these countries will increasingly\nassume obligations under the international trading system.A difficult world economic environment posed a challenge for the management\nof trade relations. U.S. trade negotiators were called upon to manage\nserious sectoral problems in such areas as steel, and helped to assure that\nU.S. chemical exports will have continued access to the European market.Close consultations with the private sector in the United States have\nenabled U.S. trade negotiators to pinpoint obstacles to U.S. trade in\nservices, and to build a basis for future negotiations. Services have been\nan increasingly important source of export earnings for the United States,\nand the United States must assure continued and increased access to foreign\nmarkets.The trade position of the United States has improved. But vigorous efforts\nare needed in a number of areas to assure continued market access for U.S.\nexports, particularly agricultural and high technology products, in which\nthe United States continues to have a strong competitive edge. Continued\nefforts are also needed to remove many domestic disincentives, which now\nhamper U.S. export growth. And we must ensure that countries do not\nmanipulate investment, or impose investment performance requirements which\ndistort trade and cost us jobs in this country.In short, we must continue to seek free--but fair--trade. That is the\npolicy my Administration has pursued from the beginning, even in areas\nwhere foreign competition has clearly affected our domestic industry. In\nthe steel industry, for instance, we have put Trigger Price Mechanism into\nplace to help prevent the dumping of steel. That action has strengthened\nthe domestic steel industry. In the automobile industry, we have worked--\nwithout resort to import quotas--to strengthen the industry's ability to\nmodernize and compete effectively.SMALL BUSINESSI have often said that there is nothing small about small business in\nAmerica. These firms account for nearly one-half our gross national\nproduct; over half of new technology; and much more than half of the jobs\ncreated by industry.Because this sector of the economy is the very lifeblood of our National\neconomy, we have done much together to improve the competitive climate for\nsmaller firms. These concerted efforts have been an integral part of my\nprogram to revitalize the economy.They include my campaign to shrink substantially the cash and time\nconsuming red tape burden imposed on business. They include my\npersonally-directed policy of ambitiously increasing the Federal\ncontracting dollars going to small firms, especially those owned by women\nand minorities. And they include my proposals to reinvigorate existing\nsmall businesses and assist the creation of new ones through tax reform;\nfinancing assistance; market expansion; and support of product innovation.Many of my initiatives to facilitate the creation and growth of small\nbusinesses were made in response to the White House Conference on Small\nBusiness, which I convened. My Administration began the implementation of\nmost of the ideas produced last year by that citizen's advisory body;\nothers need to be addressed. I have proposed the reconvening of the\nConference next year to review progress; reassess priorities; and set new\ngoals. In the interim I hope that the incoming Administration and the new\nCongress will work with the committee I have established to keep these\nbusiness development ideas alive and help implement Conference\nrecommendations.MINORITY BUSINESSOne of the most successful developments of my Administration has been the\ngrowth and strengthening of minority business. This is the first\nAdministration to put the issue on the policy agenda as a matter of major\nimportance. To implement the results of our early efforts in this field I\nsubmitted legislation to Congress designed to further the development of\nminority business.We have reorganized the Office of Minority Business into the Minority\nBusiness Development Administration in the Department of Commerce. MBDA has\nalready proven to be a major factor in assisting minority businesses to\nachieve equitable competitive positions in the marketplace.The Federal government's procurement from minority-owned firms has nearly\ntripled since I took office. Federal deposits in minority-owned banks have\nmore than doubled and minority ownership of radio and television stations\nhas nearly doubled. The SBA administered 8(a) Pilot Program for procurement\nwith the Army proved to be successful and I recently expanded the number of\nagencies involved to include NASA and the Departments of Energy and\nTransportation.I firmly believe the critical path to full freedom and equality for\nAmerica's minorities rests with the ability of minority communities to\nparticipate competitively in the free enterprise system. I believe the\ngovernment has a fundamental responsibility to assist in the development of\nminority business and I hope the progress made in the last four years will\ncontinue.II. CREATING ENERGY SECURITYSince I took office, my highest legislative priorities have involved the\nreorientation and redirection of U.S. energy activities and for the first\ntime, to establish a coordinated national energy policy. The struggle to\nachieve that policy has been long and difficult, but the accomplishments of\nthe past four years make clear that our country is finally serious about\nthe problems caused by our overdependence on foreign oil. Our progress\nshould not be lost. We must rely on and encourage multiple forms of energy\nproduction--coal, crude oil, natural gas, solar, nuclear, synthetics--and\nenergy conservation. The framework put in place over the last four years\nwill enable us to do this.NATIONAL ENERGY POLICYAs a result of actions my Administration and the Congress have taken over\nthe past four years, our country finally has a national energy policy:Under my program of phased decontrol, domestic crude oil price controls\nwill end September 30, 1981. As a result exploratory drilling activities\nhave reached an all-time high; Prices for new natural gas are being\ndecontrolled under the Natural Gas Policy Act--and natural gas production\nis now at an all time high; the supply shortages of several years ago have\nbeen eliminated; The windfall profits tax on crude oil has been enacted\nproviding $227 billion over ten years for assistance to low-income\nhouseholds, increased mass transit funding, and a massive investment in the\nproduction and development of alternative energy sources; The Synthetic\nFuels Corporation has been established to help private companies build the\nfacilities to produce energy from synthetic fuels; Solar energy funding has\nbeen quadrupled, solar energy tax credits enacted, and a Solar Energy and\nEnergy Conservation Bank has been established; A route has been chosen to\nbring natural gas from the North Slope of Alaska to the lower 48 states;\nCoal production and consumption incentives have been increased, and coal\nproduction is now at its highest level in history; A gasoline rationing\nplan has been approved by Congress for possible use in the event of a\nsevere energy supply shortage or interruption; Gasohol production has been\ndramatically increased, with a program being put in place to produce 500\nmillion gallons of alcohol fuel by the end of this year--an amount that\ncould enable gasohol to meet the demand for 10 percent of all unleaded\ngasoline; New energy conservation incentives have been provided for\nindividuals, businesses and communities and conservation has increased\ndramatically. The U.S. has reduced oil imports by 25 percent--or 2 million\nbarrels per day--over the past four years.INCREASED DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC ENERGY SOURCESAlthough it is essential that the Nation reduce its dependence on imported\nfossil fuels and complete the transition to reliance on domestic renewable\nsources of energy, it is also important that this transition be\naccomplished in an orderly, economic, and environmentally sound manner. To\nthis end, the Administration has launched several initiatives.Leasing of oil and natural gas on federal lands, particularly the outer\ncontinental shelf, has been accelerated at the same time as the\nAdministration has reformed leasing procedures through the 1978 amendments\nto the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. In 1979 the Interior Department\nheld six OCS lease sales, the greatest number ever, which resulted in\nfederal receipts of $6.5 billion, another record. The five-year OCS Leasing\nschedule was completed, requiring 36 sales over the next five years.Since 1971 no general federal coal lease sales were suspended. Over the\npast four years the Administration has completely revised the federal coal\nleasing program to bring it into compliance with the requirements of 1976\nFederal Land Planning and Management Act and other statutory provisions.\nThe program is designed to balance the competing interests that affect\nresource development on public lands and to ensure that adequate supplies\nof coal will be available to meet national needs. As a result, the first\ngeneral competitive federal coal lease sale in ten years will be held this\nmonth.In July 1980, I signed into law the Energy Security Act of 1980 which\nestablished the Synthetic Fuels Corporation. The Corporation is designed to\nspur the development of commercial technologies for production of synthetic\nfuels, such as liquid and gaseous fuels from coal and the production of oil\nfrom oil shale. The Act provides the Corporation with an initial $22\nbillion to accomplish these objectives. The principal purpose of the\nlegislation is to ensure that the nation will have available in the late\n1980's the option to undertake commercial development of synthetic fuels if\nthat becomes necessary. The Energy Security Act also provides significant\nincentives for the development of gasohol and biomass fuels, thereby\nenhancing the nation's supply of alternative energy sources.COMMITMENT TO A SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTUREThe Administration's 1977 National Energy Plan marked an historic departure\nfrom the policies of previous Administrations. The plan stressed the\nimportance of both energy production and conservation to achieving our\nultimate national goal of relying primarily on secure sources of energy.\nThe National Energy Plan made energy conservation a cornerstone of our\nnational energy policy.In 1978, I initiated the Administration's Solar Domestic Policy Review.\nThis represented the first step towards widespread introduction of\nrenewable energy sources into the Nation's economy. As a result of the\nReview, I issued the 1979 Solar Message to Congress, the first such message\nin the Nation's history. The Message outlined the Administration's solar\nprogram and established an ambitious national goal for the year 2000 of\nobtaining 20 percent of this Nation's energy from solar and renewable\nsources. The thrust of the federal solar program is to help industry\ndevelop solar energy sources by emphasizing basic research and development\nof solar technologies which are not currently economic, such as\nphotovoltaics, which generate energy directly from the sun. At the same\ntime, through tax incentives, education, and the Solar Energy and Energy\nConservation Bank, the solar program seeks to encourage state and local\ngovernments, industry, and our citizens to expand their use of solar and\nrenewable resource technologies currently available.As a result of these policies and programs, the energy efficiency of the\nAmerican economy has improved markedly and investments in renewable energy\nsources have grown significantly. It now takes 3 1/2 percent less energy to\nproduce a constant dollar of GNP than it did in January 1977. This increase\nin efficiency represents a savings of over 1.3 million barrels per day of\noil equivalent, about the level of total oil production now occurring in\nAlaska. Over the same period, Federal support for conservation and solar\nenergy has increased by more than 3000 percent, to $3.3 billion in FY 1981,\nincluding the tax credits for solar energy and energy conservation\ninvestments--these credits are expected to amount to $1.2 billion in FY\n1981 and $1.5 billion in FY 1982.COMMITMENT TO NUCLEAR SAFETY AND SECURITYSince January 1977, significant progress has been achieved in resolving\nthree critical problems resulting from the use of nuclear energy:\nradioactive waste management, nuclear safety and weapons proliferation.In 1977, the Administration announced its nuclear nonproliferation policy\nand initiated the International Fuel Cycle Evaluation. In 1978, Congress\npassed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act, an historic piece of legislation.In February 1980, the Administration transmitted its nuclear waste\nmanagement policy to the Congress. This policy was a major advance over all\nprevious efforts. The principal aspects of that policy are: acknowledging\nthe seriousness of the problem and the numerous technical and institutional\nissues; adopting a technically and environmentally conservative approach to\nthe first permanent repository; and providing the states with significant\ninvolvement in nuclear waste disposal decisions by creating the State\nPlanning Council. While much of the plan can be and is being implemented\nadministratively, some new authorities are needed. The Congress should give\nearly priority to enacting provisions for away-from-reactor storage and the\nState Planning Council.The accident at Three Mile Island made the nation acutely aware of the\nsafety risks posed by nuclear power plants. In response, the President\nestablished the Kemeny Commission to review the accident and make\nrecommendations. Virtually all of the Commission's substantive\nrecommendations were adopted by the Administration and are now being\nimplemented by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Congress adopted the\nPresident's proposed plan for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the\nNuclear Safety Oversight Committee was established to ensure that the\nAdministration's decisions were implemented.Nuclear safety will remain a vital concern in the years ahead. We must\ncontinue to press ahead for the safe, secure disposal of radioactive\nwastes, and prevention of nuclear proliferation.While significant growth in foreign demand for U.S. steam coal is foreseen,\ncongestion must be removed at major U.S. coal exporting ports such as\nHampton Roads, Virginia, and Baltimore, Maryland. My Administration has\nworked through the Interagency Coal Task Force Study to promote cooperation\nand coordination of resources between shippers, railroads, vessel broker/\noperators and port operators, and to determine the most appropriate Federal\nrole in expanding and modernizing coal export facilities, including\ndredging deeper channels at selected ports. As a result of the Task Force's\nefforts, administrative steps have been taken by the Corps of Engineers to\nreduce significantly the amount of time required for planning and economic\nreview of port dredging proposals. The Administration has also recommended\nthat the Congress enact legislation to give the President generic authority\nto recommend appropriations for channel dredging activities. Private\nindustry will, of course, play the major role in developing the United\nStates' coal export facilities, but the government must continue to work to\nfacilitate transportation to foreign markets.III. ENHANCING BASIC HUMAN AND SOCIAL NEEDSFor too long prior to my Administration, many of our Nation's basic human\nand social needs were being ignored or handled insensitively by the Federal\ngovernment. Over the last four years, we have significantly increased\nfunding for many of the vital programs in these areas; developed new\nprograms where needs were unaddressed; targeted Federal support to those\nindividuals and areas most in need of our assistance; and removed barriers\nthat have unnecessarily kept many disadvantaged citizens from obtaining aid\nfor their most basic needs.Our record has produced clear progress in the effort to solve some of the\ncountry's fundamental human and social problems. My Administration and the\nCongress, working together, have demonstrated that government must and can\nmeet our citizens' basic human and social needs in a responsible and\ncompassionate way.But there is an unfinished agenda still before the Congress. If we are to\nmeet our obligations to help all Americans realize the dreams of sound\nhealth care, decent housing, effective social services, a good education,\nand a meaningful job, important legislation still must be enacted. National\nHealth Insurance, Welfare Reform, Child Health Assessment Program, are\nbefore the Congress and I urge their passage.HEALTH NATIONAL HEALTH PLANDuring my Administration, I proposed to Congress a National Health Plan\nwhich will enable the country to reach the goal of comprehensive, universal\nhealth care coverage. The legislation I submitted lays the foundation for\nthis comprehensive plan and addresses the most serious problems of health\nfinancing and delivery. It is realistic and enactable. It does not\noverpromise or overspend, and, as a result, can be the solution to the\nthirty years of Congressional battles on national health insurance. My Plan\nincludes the following key features:Nearly 15 million additional poor would receive fully-subsidized\ncomprehensive coverage; pre-natal and delivery services are provided for\nall pregnant women and coverage is provided for all acute care for infants\nin their first year of life; the elderly and disabled would have a limit of\n$1,250 placed on annual out-of-pocket medical expenses and would no longer\nface limits on hospital coverage; all full-time employees and their\nfamilies would receive insurance against at least major medical expenses\nunder mandated employer coverage; Medicare and Medicaid would be combined\nand expanded into an umbrella Federal program, Healthcare, for increased\nprogram efficiency, accountability and uniformity; and strong cost\ncontrols and health system reforms would be implemented, including\ngreater incentives for Health Maintenance Organizations.I urge the new Congress to compare my Plan with the alternatives--programs\nwhich either do too little to improve the health care needs of Americans\nmost in need or programs which would impose substantial financial burdens\non the American taxpayers. I hope the Congress will see the need for and\nthe benefits of my Plan and work toward prompt enactment. We cannot afford\nfurther delay in this vital area.HEALTH CARE COST CONTROLInflation in health care costs remains unacceptably high. Throughout my\nAdministration, legislation to reduce health care cost inflation was one of\nmy highest priorities, but was not passed by the Congress. Therefore, my FY\n1982 budget proposes sharing the responsibility for health care cost\ncontrol with the private sector, through voluntary hospital cost guidelines\nand intensified monitoring. In the longer term, the health care\nreimbursement system must be reformed. We must move away from inflationary\ncost-based reimbursement and fee-for-service, and toward a system of\nprospective reimbursement, under which health care providers would operate\nwithin predetermined budgets. This reimbursement reform is essential to\nultimately control inflation in health care costs, and will be a\nsignificant challenge to the new Congress.HEALTH PROMOTION AND DISEASE PREVENTIONDuring my Administration, the Surgeon General released \"Healthy People,\" a\nlandmark report on health promotion and disease prevention. The report\nsignals the growing consensus that the Nation's health strategy must be\nrefocused in the 1980's to emphasize the prevention of disease.\nSpecifically, the report lays out measurable and achieveable goals in the\nreduction of mortality which can be reached by 1990.I urge the new Congress to endorse the principles of \"Healthy People,\" and\nto adopt the recommendations to achieve its goals. This will necessitate\nadoption of a broader concept of health care, to include such areas as\nenvironmental health, workplace health and safety, commercial product\nsafety, traffic safety, and health education, promotion and information.MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTHEnsuring a healthy start in life for children remains not only a high\npriority of my Administration, but also one of the most cost effective\nforms of health care.When I took office, immunization levels for preventable childhood diseases\nhad fallen to 70%. As a result of a concerted nationwide effort during my\nAdministration, I am pleased to report that now at least 90% of children\nunder 15, and virtually all school-age children are immunized. In addition,\nreported cases of measles and mumps are at their lowest levels ever.Under the National Health Plan I have proposed, there would be no\ncost-sharing for prenatal and delivery services for all pregnant women and\nfor acute care provided to infants in their first year of life. These\npreventive services have extremely high returns in terms of improved\nnewborn and long-term child health.Under the Child Health Assurance Program (CHAP) legislation which I\nsubmitted to the Congress, and which passed the House, an additional two\nmillion low-income children under 18 would become eligible for Medicaid\nbenefits, which would include special health assessments. CHAP would also\nimprove the continuity of care for the nearly 14 million children now\neligible for Medicaid. An additional 100,000 low-income pregnant women\nwould become eligible for prenatal care under the proposal. I strongly urge\nthe new Congress to enact CHAP and thereby provide millions of needy\nchildren with essential health services. The legislation has had strong\nbipartisan support, which should continue as the details of the bill are\ncompleted.I also urge the new Congress to provide strong support for two highly\nsuccessful ongoing programs: the special supplemental food program for\nwomen, infants and children (WIC) and Family Planning. The food supplements\nunder WIC have been shown to effectively prevent ill health and thereby\nreduce later medical costs. The Family Planning program has been effective\nat reducing unwanted pregnancies among low-income women and adolescents.EXPANSION OF SERVICES TO THE POOR AND UNDERSERVEDDuring my Administration, health services to the poor and underserved have\nbeen dramatically increased. The number of National Health Service Corps\n(NHSC) assignees providing services in medically underserved communities\nhas grown from 500 in 1977 to nearly 3,000 in 1981. The population served\nby the NHSC has more than tripled since 1977. The number of Community\nHealth Centers providing services in high priority underserved areas has\ndoubled during my Administration, and will serve an estimated six million\npeople in 1981. I strongly urge the new Congress to support these highly\nsuccessful programs.MENTAL HEALTHOne of the most significant health achievements during my Administration\nwas the recent passage of the Mental Health Systems Act, which grew out of\nrecommendations of my Commission on Mental Health. I join many others in my\ngratitude to the First Lady for her tireless and effective contribution to\nthe passage of this important legislation.The Act is designed to inaugurate a new era of Federal and State\npartnership in the planning and provision of mental health services. In\naddition, the Act specifically provides for prevention and support services\nto the chronically mentally ill to prevent unnecessary institutionalization\nand for the development of community-based mental health services. I urge\nthe new Congress to provide adequate support for the full and timely\nimplementation of this Act.HEALTH PROTECTIONWith my active support, the Congress recently passed \"Medigap\" legislation,\nwhich provides for voluntary certification of health insurance policies\nsupplemental to Medicare, to curb widespread abuses in this area.In the area of toxic agent control, legislation which I submitted to the\nCongress recently passed. This will provide for a \"super-fund\" to cover\nhazardous waste cleanup costs.In the area of accidental injury control, we have established automobile\nsafety standards and increased enforcement activities with respect to the\n55 MPH speed limit. By the end of the decade these actions are expected to\nsave over 13,000 lives and 100,000 serious injuries each year.I urge the new Congress to continue strong support for all these\nactivities.FOOD AND NUTRITIONBuilding on the comprehensive reform of the Food Stamp Program that I\nproposed and Congress passed in 1977, my Administration and the Congress\nworked together in 1979 and 1980 to enact several other important changes\nin the Program. These changes will further simplify administration and\nreduce fraud and error, will make the program more responsive to the needs\nof the elderly and disabled, and will increase the cap on allowable program\nexpenditures. The Food Stamp Act will expire at the end of fiscal 1981. It\nis essential that the new Administration and the Congress continue this\nprogram to ensure complete eradication of the debilitating malnutrition\nwitnessed and documented among thousands of children in the 1960's.DRUG ABUSE PREVENTIONAt the beginning of my Administration there were over a half million heroin\naddicts in the United States. Our continued emphasis on reducing the supply\nof heroin, as well as providing treatment and rehabilitation to its\nvictims, has reduced the heroin addict population, reduced the number of\nheroin overdose deaths by 80%, and reduced the number of heroin related\ninjuries by 50%. We have also seen and encouraged a national movement of\nparents and citizens committed to reversing the very serious and disturbing\ntrends of adolescent drug abuse.Drug abuse in many forms will continue to detract, however, from the\nquality of life of many Americans. To prevent that, I see four great\nchallenges in the years ahead. First, we must deal aggressively with the\nsupplies of illegal drugs at their source, through joint crop destruction\nprograms with foreign nations and increased law enforcement and border\ninterdiction. Second, we must look to citizens and parents across the\ncountry to help educate the increasing numbers of American youth who are\nexperimenting with drugs to the dangers of drug abuse. Education is a key\nfactor in reducing drug abuse. Third, we must focus our efforts on drug and\nalcohol abuse in the workplace for not only does this abuse contribute to\nlow productivity but it also destroys the satisfaction and sense of purpose\nall Americans can gain from the work experience. Fourth, we need a change\nin attitude, from an attitude which condones the casual use of drugs to one\nthat recognizes the appropriate use of drugs for medical purposes and\ncondemns the inappropriate and harmful abuse of drugs. I hope the Congress\nand the new Administration will take action to meet each of these\nchallenges.EDUCATIONThe American people have always recognized that education is one of the\nsoundest investments they can make. The dividends are reflected in every\ndimension of our national life--from the strength of our economy and\nnational security to the vitality of our music, art, and literature. Among\nthe accomplishments that have given me the most satisfaction over the last\nfour years are the contributions that my Administration has been able to\nmake to the well-being of students and educators throughout the country.This Administration has collaborated successfully with the Congress on\nlandmark education legislation. Working with the Congressional leadership,\nmy Administration spotlighted the importance of education by creating a new\nDepartment of Education. The Department has given education a stronger\nvoice at the Federal level, while at the same time reserving the actual\ncontrol and operation of education to states, localities, and private\ninstitutions. The Department has successfully combined nearly 150 Federal\neducation programs into a cohesive, streamlined organization that is more\nresponsive to the needs of educators and students. The Department has made\nstrides to cut red tape and paperwork and thereby to make the flow of\nFederal dollars to school districts and institutions of higher education\nmore efficient. It is crucial that the Department be kept intact and\nstrengthened.Our collaboration with the Congress has resulted in numerous other\nimportant legislative accomplishments for education. A little over two\nyears ago, I signed into law on the same day two major bills--one\nbenefiting elementary and secondary education and the other, postsecondary\neducation. The Education Amendments of 1978 embodied nearly all of my\nAdministration's proposals for improvements in the Elementary and Secondary\nEducation Act, including important new programs to improve students'\nachievement in the basic skills and to aid school districts with\nexceptionally high concentrations of children from low-income families. The\nMiddle Income Student Assistance Act, legislation jointly sponsored by this\nAdministration and the Congressional leadership, expanded eligibility for\nneed-based Basic Educational Opportunity Grants to approximately one-third\nof the students enrolled in post-secondary education and made many more\nstudents eligible for the first time for other types of grants, work-study,\nand loans.Just three and a half months ago, my Administration and the Congress\nsuccessfully concluded over two years of work on a major reauthorization\nbill that further expands benefits to postsecondary education. Reflected in\nthe Education Amendments of 1980 are major Administration recommendations\nfor improvements in the Higher Education Act--including proposals for\nbetter loan access for students; a new parent loan program; simplified\napplication procedures for student financial aid; a strengthened Federal\ncommitment to developing colleges, particularly the historically Black\ninstitutions; a new authorization for equipment and facilities\nmodernization funding for the nation's major research universities; and\nrevitalized international education programs.Supplementing these legislative accomplishments have been important\nadministrative actions aimed at reducing paperwork and simplifying\nregulations associated with Federal education programs. We also launched\nmajor initiatives to reduce the backlog of defaulted student loans and\notherwise to curb fraud, abuse, and waste in education programs.To insure that the education enterprise is ready to meet the scientific and\ntechnological changes of the future, we undertook a major study of the\nstatus of science and engineering education throughout the nation. I hope\nthat the findings from this report will serve as a springboard for needed\nreforms at all levels of education.I am proud that this Administration has been able to provide the financial\nmeans to realize many of our legislative and administrative goals. Compared\nto the previous administration's last budget, I have requested the largest\noverall increase in Federal funding for education in our nation's history.\nMy budget requests have been particularly sensitive to the needs of special\npopulations like minorities, women, the educationally and economically\ndisadvantaged, the handicapped, and students with limited English-speaking\nability. At the same time, I have requested significant increases for many\nprograms designed to enhance the quality of American education, including\nprograms relating to important areas as diverse as international education,\nresearch libraries, museums, and teacher centers.Last year, I proposed to the Congress a major legislative initiative that\nwould direct $2 billion into education and job training programs designed\nto alleviate youth unemployment through improved linkages between the\nschools and the work place. This legislation generated bipartisan support;\nbut unfortunately, action on it was not completed in the final, rushed days\nof the 96th Congress. I urge the new Congress--as it undertakes broad\nefforts to strengthen the economy as well as more specific tasks like\nreauthorizing the Vocational Education Act--to make the needs of our\nnation's unemployed youth a top priority for action. Only by combining a\nbasic skills education program together with work training and employment\nincentives can we make substantial progress in eliminating one of the most\nsevere social problems in our nation--youth unemployment, particularly\namong minorities. I am proud of the progress already made through passage\nof the Youth Employment and Demonstration Project Act of 1977 and the\nsubstantial increase in our investment in youth employment programs. The\nnew legislation would cap these efforts.INCOME SECURITY SOCIAL SECURITYOne of the highest priorities of my Administration has been to continue the\ntradition of effectiveness and efficiency widely associated with the social\nsecurity program, and to assure present and future beneficiaries that they\nwill receive their benefits as expected. The earned benefits that are paid\nmonthly to retired and disabled American workers and their families provide\na significant measure of economic protection to millions of people who\nmight otherwise face retirement or possible disability with fear. I have\nenacted changes to improve the benefits of many social security\nbeneficiaries during my years as President.The last four years have presented a special set of concerns over the\nfinancial stability of the social security system. Shortly after taking\noffice I proposed and Congress enacted legislation to protect the stability\nof the old age and survivors trust fund and prevent the imminent exhaustion\nof the disability insurance trust fund, and to correct a flaw in the\nbenefit formula that was threatening the long run health of the entire\nsocial security system. The actions taken by the Congress at my request\nhelped stabilize the system. That legislation was later complemented by the\nDisability Insurance Amendments of 1980 which further bolstered the\ndisability insurance program, and reduced certain inequities among\nbeneficiaries.My commitment to the essential retirement and disability protection\nprovided to 35 million people each month has been demonstrated by the fact\nthat without interruption those beneficiaries have continued to receive\ntheir social security benefits, including annual cost of living increases.\nChanging and unpredictable economic circumstances require that we continue\nto monitor the financial stability of the social security system. To\ncorrect anticipated short-term strains on the system, I proposed last year\nthat the three funds be allowed to borrow from one another, and I urge the\nCongress again this year to adopt such interfund borrowing. To further\nstrengthen the social security system and provide a greater degree of\nassurance to beneficiaries, given projected future economic uncertainties,\nadditional action should be taken. Among the additional financing options\navailable are borrowing from the general fund, financing half of the\nhospital insurance fund with general revenues, and increasing the payroll\ntax rate. The latter option is particularly unpalatable given the\nsignificant increase in the tax rate already mandated in law.This Administration continues to oppose cuts in basic social security\nbenefits and taxing social security benefits. The Administration continues\nto support annual indexing of social security benefits.WELFARE REFORMIn 1979 I proposed a welfare reform package which offers solutions to some\nof the most urgent problems in our welfare system. This proposal is\nembodied in two bills, The Work and Training Opportunities Act and The\nSocial Welfare Reform Amendments Act. The House passed the second of these\ntwo proposals. Within the framework of our present welfare system, my\nreform proposals offer achievable means to increase self-sufficiency\nthrough work rather than welfare, more adequate assistance to people unable\nto work, the removal of inequities in coverage under current programs, and\nfiscal relief needed by States and localities.Our current welfare system is long overdue for serious reform; the system\nis wasteful and not fully effective. The legislation I have proposed will\nhelp eliminate inequities by establishing a national minimum benefit, and\nby directly relating benefit levels to the poverty threshold. It will\nreduce program complexity, which leads to inefficiency and waste, by\nsimplifying and coordinating administration among different programs.I urge the Congress to take action in this area along the lines I have\nrecommended.CHILD WELFAREMy Administration has worked closely with the Congress on legislation which\nis designed to improve greatly the child welfare services and foster care\nprograms and to create a Federal system of adoption assistance. These\nimprovements will be achieved with the recent enactment of H.R. 3434, the\nAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980. The well-being of\nchildren in need of homes and their permanent placement have been a primary\nconcern of my Administration. This legislation will ensure that children\nare not lost in the foster care system, but instead will be returned to\ntheir families where possible or placed in permanent adoptive homes.LOW-INCOME ENERGY ASSISTANCEIn 1979 I proposed a program to provide an annual total of $1.6 billion to\nlow-income households which are hardest hit by rising energy bills. With\nthe cooperation of Congress, we were able to move quickly to provide\nassistance to eligible households in time to meet their winter heating\nbills.In response to the extreme heat conditions affecting many parts of the\ncountry during 1980, I directed the Community Services Administration to\nmake available over $27 million to assist low-income individuals,\nespecially the elderly, facing life threatening circumstances due to\nextreme heat.Congress amended and reauthorized the low-income energy assistance program\nfor fiscal year 1981, and provided $1.85 billion to meet anticipated\nincreasing need. The need for a program to help low-income households with\nrising energy expenses will not abate in the near future. The low-income\nenergy assistance program should be reauthorized to meet those needs.HOUSINGFor the past 14 months, high interest rates have had a severe impact on the\nnation's housing market. Yet the current pressures and uncertainties should\nnot obscure the achievements of the past four years.Working with the Congress, the regulatory agencies, and the financial\ncommunity, my Administration has brought about an expanded and steadier\nflow of funds into home mortgages. Deregulation of the interest rates\npayable by depository institutions, the evolution of variable and\nrenegotiated rate mortgages, development of high yielding savings\ncertificates, and expansion of the secondary mortgage market have all\nincreased housing's ability to attract capital and have assured that\nmortgage money would not be cut off when interest rates rose. These actions\nwill diminish the cyclicality of the housing industry. Further, we have\nsecured legislation updating the Federal Government's emergency authority\nto provide support for the housing industry through the Brooke-Cranston\nprogram, and creating a new Section 235 housing stimulus program. These\ntools will enable the Federal Government to deal quickly and effectively\nwith serious distress in this critical industry.We have also worked to expand homeownership opportunities for Americans. By\nusing innovative financing mechanisms, such as the graduated payment\nmortgage, we have increased the access of middle income families to housing\ncredit. By revitalizing the Section 235 program, we have enabled nearly\n100,000 moderate income households to purchase new homes. By reducing\npaperwork and regulation in Federal programs, and by working with State and\nlocal governments to ease the regulatory burden, we have helped to hold\ndown housing costs and produce affordable housing.As a result of these governmentwide efforts, 5 1/2 million more American\nfamilies bought homes in the past four years than in any equivalent period\nin history. And more than 7 million homes have begun construction during my\nAdministration, 1 million more than in the previous four years.We have devoted particular effort to meeting the housing needs of low and\nmoderate income families. In the past four years, more than 1 million\nsubsidized units have been made available for occupancy by lower income\nAmericans and more than 600,000 assisted units have gone into construction.\nIn addition, we have undertaken a series of measures to revitalize and\npreserve the nation's 2 million units of public and assisted housing.For Fiscal Year 1982, I am proposing to continue our commitment to lower\nincome housing. I am requesting funds to support 260,000 units of Section 8\nand public housing, maintaining these programs at the level provided by\nCongress in Fiscal 1981.While we have made progress in the past four years, in the future there are\nreasons for concern. Home price inflation and high interest rates threaten\nto put homeownership out of reach for first-time homebuyers. Lower income\nhouseholds, the elderly and those dependent upon rental housing face rising\nrents, low levels of rental housing construction by historic standards, and\nthe threat of displacement due to conversion to condominiums and other\nfactors. Housing will face strong competition for investment capital from\nthe industrial sector generally and the energy industries, in particular.To address these issues, I appointed a Presidential Task Force and Advisory\nGroup last October. While this effort will not proceed due to the election\nresult, I hope the incoming Administration will proceed with a similar\nventure.The most important action government can take to meet America's housing\nneeds is to restore stability to the economy and bring down the rate of\ninflation. Inflation has driven up home prices, operating costs and\ninterest rates. Market uncertainty about inflation has contributed to the\ninstability in interest rates, which has been an added burden to\nhomebuilders and homebuyers alike. By making a long-term commitment to\nprovide a framework for greater investment, sustained economic growth, and\nprice stability, my Administration has begun the work of creating a healthy\nenvironment for housing.TRANSPORTATIONWith the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, the Motor Carrier\nAct of 1980, and the Harley O. Staggers Rail Act of 1980, my\nAdministration, working with the Congress, has initiated a new era of\nreduced regulation of transportation industries. Deregulation will lead to\nincreased productivity and operating efficiencies in the industries\ninvolved, and stimulate price and service competition, to the benefit of\nconsumers generally. I urge the new Administration to continue our efforts\non behalf of deregulation legislation for the intercity passenger bus\nindustry as well.In the coming decade, the most significant challenge facing the nation in\ntransportation services will be to improve a deteriorating physical\ninfrastructure of roadways, railroads, waterways and mass transit systems,\nin order to conserve costly energy supplies while promoting effective\ntransportation services.HIGHWAYSOur vast network of highways, which account for 90 percent of travel and 80\npercent by value of freight traffic goods movement, is deteriorating. If\ncurrent trends continue, a major proportion of the Interstate pavement will\nhave deteriorated by the end of the 1980's.Arresting the deterioration of the nation's system of highways is a high\npriority objective for the 1980's. We must reorient the Federal mission\nfrom major new construction projects to the stewardship of the existing\nInterstate Highway System. Interstate gaps should be judged on the\nconnections they make and on their compatibility with community needs.During this decade, highway investments will be needed to increase\nproductivity, particularly in the elimination of bottlenecks, provide more\nefficient connections to ports and seek low-cost solutions to traffic\ndemand.My Administration has therefore recommended redefining completion of the\nInterstate system, consolidating over 27 categorical assistance programs\ninto nine, and initiating a major repair and rehabilitation program for\nsegments of the Interstate system. This effort should help maintain the\ncondition and performance of the Nation's highways, particularly the\nInterstate and primary system; provide a realistic means to complete the\nInterstate system by 1990; ensure better program delivery through\nconsolidation, and assist urban revitalization. In addition, the Congress\nmust address the urgent funding problems of the highway trust fund, and the\nneed to generate greater revenues.MASS TRANSITIn the past decade the nation's public transit systems' ridership increased\nat an annual average of 1.1% each year in the 1970's (6.9% in 1979).\nContinued increases in the cost of fuel are expected to make transit a\ngrowing part of the nation's transportation system.As a result, my Administration projected a ten year, $43 billion program to\nincrease mass transit capacity by 50 percent, and promote more energy\nefficient vehicle uses in the next decade. The first part of this proposal\nwas the five year, $24.7 billion Urban Mass Transportation Administration\nreauthorization legislation I sent to the Congress in March, 1980. I urge\nthe 97th Congress to quickly enact this or similar legislation in 1981.My Administration was also the first to have proposed and signed into law a\nnon-urban formula grant program to assist rural areas and small communities\nwith public transportation programs to end their dependence on the\nautomobile, promote energy conservation and efficiency, and provide\ntransportation services to impoverished rural communities.A principal need of the 1980's will be maintaining mobility for all\nsegments of the population in the face of severely increasing\ntransportation costs and uncertainty of fuel supplies. We must improve the\nflexibility of our transportation system and offer greater choice and\ndiversity in transportation services. While the private automobile will\ncontinue to be the principal means of transportation for many Americans,\npublic transportation can become an increasingly attractive alternative.\nWe, therefore, want to explore a variety of paratransit modes, various\ntypes of buses, modern rapid transit, regional rail systems and light rail\nsystems.Highway planning and transit planning must be integrated and related to\nState, regional, district and neighborhood planning efforts now in place or\nemerging. Low density development and land use threaten the fiscal capacity\nof many communities to support needed services and infrastructure.ELDERLY AND HANDICAPPED TRANSPORTATIONTransportation policies in the 1980's must pay increasing attention to the\nneeds of the elderly and handicapped. By 1990, the number of people over 65\nwill have grown from today's 19 million to 27 million. During the same\nperiod, the number of handicapped--people who have difficulty using\ntransit as well as autos, including the elderly--is expected to increase\nfrom 9 to 11 million, making up 4.5 percent of the population.We must not retreat from a policy that affords a significant and growing\nportion of our population accessible public transportation while\nrecognizing that the handicapped are a diverse group and will need\nflexible, door-to-door service where regular public transportation will not\ndo the job.RAILROADSIn addition, the Federal government must reassess the appropriate Federal\nrole of support for passenger and freight rail services such as Amtrak and\nConrail. Our goal through federal assistance should be to maintain and\nenhance adequate rail service, where it is not otherwise available to needy\ncommunities. But Federal subsidies must be closely scrutinized to be sure\nthey are a stimulus to, and not a replacement for, private investment and\ninitiative. Federal assistance cannot mean permanent subsidies for\nunprofitable operations.WATERWAYS AND RURAL TRANSPORTATIONThere is a growing need in rural and small communities for improved\ntransportation services. Rail freight service to many communities has\ndeclined as railroads abandon unproductive branch lines. At the same time,\nrural roads are often inadequate to handle large, heavily-loaded trucks.\nThe increased demand for \"harvest to harbor\" service has also placed an\nincreased burden on rural transportation systems, while bottlenecks along\nthe Mississippi River delay grain shipments to the Gulf of Mexico.We have made some progress:--To further develop the nation's waterways, my Administration began\nconstruction of a new 1,200 foot lock at the site of Lock and Dam 26 on the\nMississippi River. When opened in 1987, the new lock will have a capacity\nof 86 million tons per year, an 18 percent increase over the present\nsystem. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has also undertaken studies to\nassess the feasibility of expanding the Bonneville Locks. Rehabilitation of\nJohn Day Lock was begun in 1980 and should be completed in 1982. My\nAdministration also supports the completion of the Upper Mississippi River\nMaster Plan to determine the feasibility of constructing a second lock at\nAlton, Illinois. These efforts will help alleviate delays in transporting\ncorn, soybeans and other goods along the Mississippi River to the Gulf of\nMexico.--The Department of Transportation's new Small Community and Rural\nTransportation Policy will target federal assistance for passenger\ntransportation, roads and highways, truck service, and railroad freight\nservice to rural areas. This policy implements and expands upon the earlier\nWhite House Initiative, \"Improving Transportation in Rural America,\"\nannounced in June, 1979, and the President's \"Small Community and Rural\nDevelopment Policy\" announced in December, 1979. The Congress should seek\nways to balance rail branch line abandonment with the service needs of\nrural and farm communities, provide financial assistance to rail branch\nline rehabilitation where appropriate, assist shippers to adjust to rail\nbranch line abandonment where it takes place, and help make it possible for\ntrucking firms to serve light density markets with dependable and efficient\ntrucking services.MARITIME POLICYDuring my Administration I have sought to ensure that the U.S. maritime\nindustry will not have to function at an unfair competitive disadvantage in\nthe international market. As I indicated in my maritime policy statement to\nthe Congress in July, 1979, the American merchant marine is vital to our\nNation's welfare, and Federal actions should promote rather than harm it.\nIn pursuit of this objective, I signed into law the Controlled Carrier Act\nof 1978, authorizing the Federal Maritime Commission to regulate certain\nrate cutting practices of some state-controlled carriers, and recently\nsigned a bilateral maritime agreement with the People's Republic of China\nthat will expand the access of American ships to 20 specified Chinese\nports, and set aside for American-flag ships a substantial share (at least\none-third) of the cargo between our countries. This agreement should\nofficially foster expanded U.S. and Chinese shipping services linking the\ntwo countries, and will provide further momentum to the growth of\nSino-American trade.There is also a need to modernize and expand the dry bulk segment of our\nfleet. Our heavy dependence on foreign carriage of U.S.-bulk cargoes\ndeprives the U.S. economy of seafaring and shipbuilding jobs, adds to the\nbalance-of-payments deficit, deprives the Government of substantial tax\nrevenues, and leaves the United States dependent on foreign-flag shipping\nfor a continued supply of raw materials to support the civil economy and\nwar production in time of war.I therefore sent to the Congress proposed legislation to strengthen this\nwoefully weak segment of the U.S.-flag fleet by removing certain\ndisincentives to U.S. construction of dry bulkers and their operation under\nU.S. registry. Enactment of this proposed legislation would establish the\nbasis for accelerating the rebuilding of the U.S.-flag dry bulk fleet\ntoward a level commensurate with the position of the United States as the\nworld's leading bulk trading country.During the past year the Administration has stated its support for\nlegislation that would provide specific Federal assistance for the\ninstallation of fuel-efficient engines in existing American ships, and\nwould strengthen this country's shipbuilding mobilization base.\nStrengthening the fleet is important, but we must also maintain our\nshipbuilding base for future ship construction.Provisions in existing laws calling for substantial or exclusive use of\nAmerican-flag vessels to carry cargoes generated by the Government must be\nvigorously pursued.I have therefore supported requirements that 50 percent of oil purchased\nfor the strategic petroleum reserve be transported in U.S.-flag vessels,\nthat the Cargo Preference Act be applied to materials furnished for the\nU.S. assisted construction of air bases in Israel, and to cargoes\ntransported pursuant to the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act. In\naddition, the deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act requires that at least\none ore carrier per mine site be a U.S.-flag vessel.Much has been done, and much remains to be done. The FY 1982 budget\nincludes a $107 million authorization for Construction Differential Subsidy\n(\"CDS\") funds which, added to the unobligated CDS balance of $100 million\nfrom 1980, and the recently enacted $135 million 1981 authorization, will\nprovide an average of $171 million in CDS funds in 1981 and 1982.COAL EXPORT POLICYWhile significant growth in foreign demand for U.S. steam coal is foreseen,\ncongestion at major U.S. coal exporting ports such as Hampton Roads,\nVirginia, and Baltimore, Maryland, could delay and impede exports.My Administration has worked through the Interagency Coal Task Force Study,\nwhich I created, to promote cooperation and coordination of resources\nbetween shippers, railroads, vessel broker/ operators and port operators,\nand to determine the most appropriate Federal role in expanding and\nmodernizing coal export facilities, including dredging deeper channels at\nselected ports.Some progress has already been made. In addition to action taken by\ntransshippers to reduce the number of coal classifications used whenever\npossible, by the Norfolk and Western Railroad to upgrade its computer\ncapability to quickly inventory its coal cars in its yards, and by the\nChessie Railroad which is reactivating Pier 15 in Newport News and has\nestablished a berth near its Curtis Bay Pier in Baltimore to decrease\ndelays in vessel berthing, public activities will include:--A $26.5 million plan developed by the State of Pennsylvania and Conrail\nto increase Conrail's coal handling capacity at Philadelphia;--A proposal by the State of Virginia to construct a steam coal port on\nthe Craney Island Disposal area in Portsmouth harbor;--Plans by Mobile, Alabama, which operates the only publicly owned coal\nterminal in the U.S. to enlarge its capacity at McDuffie Island to 10\nmillion tons ground storage and 100 car unit train unloading capability;--Development at New Orleans of steam coal facilities that are expected to\nadd over 20 million tons of annual capacity by 1983; and--The Corps of Engineers, working with other interested Federal agencies,\nwill determine which ports should be dredged, to what depth and on what\nschedule, in order to accommodate larger coal carrying vessels.Private industry will, of course, play a major role in developing the\nUnited States' coal export facilities. The new Administration should\ncontinue to work to eliminate transportation bottlenecks that impede our\naccess to foreign markets.Special NeedsWOMENThe past four years have been years of rapid advancement for women. Our\nfocus has been two-fold: to provide American women with a full range of\nopportunities and to make them a part of the mainstream of every aspect of\nour national life and leadership.I have appointed a record number of women to judgeships and to top\ngovernment posts. Fully 22 percent of all my appointees are women, and I\nnominated 41 of the 46 women who sit on the Federal bench today. For the\nfirst time in our history, women occupy policymaking positions at the\nhighest level of every Federal agency and department and have demonstrated\ntheir ability to serve our citizens well.We have strengthened the rights of employed women by consolidating and\nstrengthening enforcement of sex discrimination laws under the EEOC, by\nexpanding employment rights of pregnant women through the Pregnancy\nDisability Bill, and by increasing federal employment opportunities for\nwomen through civil service reform, and flexi-time and part-time\nemployment.By executive order, I created the first national program to provide women\nbusinessowners with technical assistance, grants, loans, and improved\naccess to federal contracts.We have been sensitive to the needs of women who are homemakers. I\nestablished an Office of Families within HHS and sponsored the White House\nConference on Families. We initiated a program targeting CETA funds to help\ndisplaced homemakers. The Social Security system was amended to eliminate\nthe widow's penalty and a comprehensive study of discriminatory provisions\nand possible changes was presented to Congress. Legislation was passed to\ngive divorced spouses of foreign service officers rights to share in\npension benefits.We created an office on domestic violence within HHS to coordinate the 12\nagencies that now have domestic violence relief programs, and to distribute\ninformation on the problem and the services available to victims.Despite a stringent budget for FY 1981, the Administration consistently\nsupported the Women's Educational Equity Act and family planning\nactivities, as well as other programs that affect women, such as food\nstamps, WIC, and social security.We have been concerned not only about the American woman's opportunities,\nbut ensuring equality for women around the world. In November, 1980, I sent\nto the Senate the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination Against Women. This United Nations document is the most\ncomprehensive and detailed international agreement which seeks the\nadvancement of women.On women's issues, I have sought the counsel of men and women in and out of\ngovernment and from all regions of our country. I established two panels--\nthe President's Advisory Committee for Women and the Interdepartmental Task\nForce on Women--to advise me on these issues. The mandate for both groups\nexpired on December 31, but they have left behind a comprehensive review of\nthe status of women in our society today. That review provides excellent\nguidance for the work remaining in our battle against sex discrimination.Even though we have made progress, much remains on the agenda for women. I\nremain committed to the Equal Rights Amendment and will continue to work\nfor its passage. It is essential to the goal of bringing America's women\nfully into the mainstream of American life that the ERA be ratified.The efforts begun for women in employment, business and education should be\ncontinued and strengthened. Money should be available to states to\nestablish programs to help the victims of domestic violence. Congress\nshould pass a national health care plan and a welfare reform program, and\nthese measures should reflect the needs of women.The talents of women should continue to be used to the fullest inside and\noutside of government, and efforts should continue to see that they have\nthe widest range of opportunities and options.HANDICAPPEDI hope that my Administration will be remembered in this area for leading\nthe way toward full civil rights for handicapped Americans. When I took\noffice, no federal agency had yet issued 504 regulations. As I leave\noffice, this first step by every major agency and department in the federal\ngovernment is almost complete. But it is only a first step. The years ahead\nwill require steadfast dedication by the President to protect and promote\nthese precious rights in the classroom, in the workplace, and in all public\nfacilities so that handicapped individuals may join the American mainstream\nand contribute to the fullest their resources and talents to our economic\nand social life.Just as we supported, in an unprecedented way, the civil rights of disabled\npersons in schools and in the workplace, other initiatives in health\nprevention, such as our immunization and nutrition programs for young\nchildren and new intense efforts to reverse spinal cord injury, must\ncontinue so that the incidence of disability continues to decline.This year is the U.N.-declared International Year of Disabled Persons. We\nare organizing activities to celebrate and promote this important\ncommemorative year within the government as well as in cooperation with\nprivate sector efforts in this country and around the world. The\nInternational Year will give our country the opportunity to recognize the\ntalents and capabilities of our fellow citizens with disabilities. We can\nalso share our rehabilitation and treatment skills with other countries and\nlearn from them as well. I am proud that the United States leads the world\nin mainstreaming and treating disabled people. However, we have a long way\nto go before all psychological and physical barriers to disabled people are\ntorn down and they can be full participants in our American way of life. We\nmust pledge our full commitment to this goal during the International Year.FAMILIESBecause of my concern for American families, my Administration convened\nlast year the first White House Conference on Families which involved seven\nnational hearings, over 506 state and local events, three White House\nConferences, and the direct participation of more than 125,000 citizens.\nThe Conference reaffirmed the centrality of families in our lives and\nnation but documented problems American families face as well. We also\nestablished the Office of Families within the Department of Health and\nHuman Services to review government policies and programs that affect\nfamilies.I expect the departments and agencies within the executive branch of the\nFederal government as well as Members of Congress, corporate and business\nleaders, and State and local officials across the country, to study closely\nthe recommendations of the White House Conference and implement them\nappropriately. As public policy is developed and implemented by the Federal\ngovernment, cognizance of the work of the Conference should be taken as a\npragmatic and essential step.The Conference has done a good job of establishing an agenda for action to\nassure that the policies of the Federal government are more sensitive in\ntheir impact on families. I hope the Congress will review and seriously\nconsider the Conference's recommendations.OLDER AMERICANSMy Administration has taken great strides toward solving the difficult\nproblems faced by older Americans. Early in my term we worked successfully\nwith the Congress to assure adequate revenues for the Social Security Trust\nFunds. And last year the strength of the Social Security System was\nstrengthened by legislation I proposed to permit borrowing among the\nseparate trust funds. I have also signed into law legislation prohibiting\nemployers from requiring retirement prior to age 70, and removing mandatory\nretirement for most Federal employees. In addition, my Administration\nworked very closely with Congress to amend the Older Americans Act in a way\nthat has already improved administration of its housing, social services,\nfood delivery, and employment programs.This year, I will be submitting to Congress a budget which again\ndemonstrates my commitment to programs for the elderly. It will include, as\nmy previous budgets have, increased funding for nutrition, senior centers\nand home health care, and will focus added resources on the needs of older\nAmericans.With the 1981 White House Conference on Aging approaching, I hope the new\nAdministration will make every effort to assure an effective and useful\nconference. This Conference should enable older Americans to voice their\nconcerns and give us guidance in our continued efforts to ensure the\nquality of life so richly deserved by our senior citizens.REFUGEESWe cannot hope to build a just and humane society at home if we ignore the\nhumanitarian claims of refugees, their lives at stake, who have nowhere\nelse to turn. Our country can be proud that hundreds of thousands of people\naround the world would risk everything they have--including their own\nlives--to come to our country.This Administration initiated and implemented the first comprehensive\nreform of our refugee and immigration policies in over 25 years. We also\nestablished the first refugee coordination office in the Department of\nState under the leadership of a special ambassador and coordinator for\nrefugee affairs and programs. The new legislation and the coordinator's\noffice will bring common sense and consolidation to our Nation's previously\nfragmented, inconsistent, and in many ways, outdated, refugee and\nimmigration policies.With the unexpected arrival of thousands of Cubans and Haitians who sought\nrefuge in our country last year, outside of our regular immigration and\nrefugee admissions process, our country and its government were tested in\nbeing compassionate and responsive to a major human emergency. Because we\nhad taken steps to reorganize our refugee programs, we met that test\nsuccessfully. I am proud that the American people responded to this crisis\nwith their traditional good will and hospitality. Also, we would never have\nbeen able to handle this unprecedented emergency without the efforts of the\nprivate resettlement agencies who have always been there to help refugees\nin crises.Immigrants to this country always contribute more toward making our country\nstronger than they ever take from the system. I am confident that the\nnewest arrivals to our country will carry on this tradition.While we must remain committed to aiding and assisting those who come to\nour shores, at the same time we must uphold our immigration and refugee\npolicies and provide adequate enforcement resources. As a result of our\nenforcement policy, the illegal flow from Cuba has been halted and an\norderly process has been initiated to make certain that our refugee and\nimmigration laws are honored.This year the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy will\ncomplete its work and forward its advice and recommendations. I hope that\nthe recommendations will be carefully considered by the new Administration\nand the Congress, for it is clear that we must take additional action to\nkeep our immigration policy responsive to emergencies and ever changing\ntimes.VETERANSThis country and its leadership has a continuing and unique obligation to\nthe men and women who served their nation in the armed forces and help\nmaintain or restore peace in the world.My commitment to veterans, as evidenced by my record, is characterized by a\nconscientious and consistent emphasis in these general areas:First, we have worked to honor the Vietnam veteran. During my\nAdministration, and under the leadership of VA Administrator Max Cleland, I\nwas proud to lead our country in an overdue acknowledgement of our Nation's\ngratitude to the men and women who served their country during the bitter\nwar in Southeast Asia. Their homecoming was deferred and seemed doomed to\nbe ignored. Our country has matured in the last four years and at long last\nwe were able to separate the war from the warrior and honor these veterans.\nBut with our acknowledgement of their service goes an understanding that\nsome Vietnam veterans have unique needs and problems.My Administration was able to launch a long sought after psychological\nreadjustment and outreach program, unprecedented in its popularity,\nsensitivity and success. This program must be continued. The Administration\nhas also grappled with the difficult questions posed by some veterans who\nserved in Southeast Asia and were exposed to potentially harmful\nsubstances, including the herbicide known as Agent Orange. We have launched\nscientific inquiries that should answer many veterans' questions about\ntheir health and should provide the basis for establishing sound\ncompensation policy. We cannot rest until their concerns are dealt with in\na sensitive, expeditious and compassionate fashion.Second, we have focused the VA health care system in the needs of the\nservice-connected disabled veteran. We initiated and are implementing the\nfirst reform of the VA vocational rehabilitation system since its inception\nin 1943. Also, my Administration was the first to seek a cost-of-living\nincrease for the recipients of VA compensation every year. My last budget\nalso makes such a request. The Administration also launched the Disabled\nVeterans Outreach Program in the Department of Labor which has successfully\nplaced disabled veterans in jobs. Services provided by the VA health care\nsystem will be further targeted to the special needs of disabled veterans\nduring the coming year.Third, the VA health care system, the largest in the free world, has\nmaintained its independence and high quality during my Administration. We\nhave made the system more efficient and have therefore treated more\nveterans than ever before by concentrating on out-patient care and through\nmodern management improvements. As the median age of the American veteran\npopulation increases, we must concentrate on further changes within the VA\nsystem to keep it independent and to serve as a model to the nation and to\nthe world as a center for research, treatment and rehabilitation.Government AssistanceGENERAL AID TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTSSince taking office, I have been strongly committed to strengthening the\nfiscal and economic condition of our Nation's State and local governments.\nI have accomplished this goal by encouraging economic development of local\ncommunities, and by supporting the General Revenue Sharing and other\nessential grant-in-aid programs.GRANTS-IN-AID TO STATES AND LOCALITIESDuring my Administration, total grants-in-aid to State and local\ngovernments have increased by more than 40 percent, from $68 billion in\nFiscal Year 1977 to $96 billion in Fiscal Year 1981. This significant\nincrease in aid has allowed States and localities to maintain services that\nare essential to their citizens without imposing onerous tax burdens. It\nalso has allowed us to establish an unprecedented partnership between the\nleaders of the Federal government and State and local government elected\nofficials.GENERAL REVENUE SHARINGLast year Congress enacted legislation that extends the General Revenue\nSharing program for three more years. This program is the cornerstone of\nour efforts to maintain the fiscal health of our Nation's local government.\nIt will provide $4.6 billion in each of the next three years to cities,\ncounties and towns. This program is essential to the continued ability of\nour local governments to provide essential police, fire and sanitation\nservices.This legislation renewing GRS will be the cornerstone of\nFederal-State-local government relations in the 1980's. This policy will\nemphasize the need for all levels of government to cooperate in order to\nmeet the needs of the most fiscally strained cities and counties, and also\nwill emphasize the important role that GRS can play in forging this\npartnership. I am grateful that Congress moved quickly to assure that our\nNation's localities can begin the 1980's in sound fiscal condition.COUNTER-CYCLICAL ASSISTANCELast year, I proposed that Congress enact a $1 billion counter-cyclical\nfiscal assistance program to protect States and localities from unexpected\nchanges in the national economy. This program unfortunately was not enacted\nby the [full] Congress. I, therefore, have not included funding for\ncounter-cyclical aid in my Fiscal Year 1982 budget. Nevertheless, I urge\nCongress to enact a permanent stand-by counter-cyclical program, so that\nStates and cities can be protected during the next economic downturn.URBAN POLICYThree years ago, I proposed the Nation's first comprehensive urban policy.\nThat policy involved more than one hundred improvements in existing Federal\nprograms, four new Executive Orders and nineteen pieces of urban-oriented\nlegislation. With Congress' cooperation, sixteen of these bills have now\nbeen signed into law.ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTOne of the principal goals of my domestic policy has been to strengthen the\nprivate sector economic base of our Nation's economically troubled urban\nand rural areas. With Congress' cooperation, we have substantially expanded\nthe Federal government's economic development programs and provided new tax\nincentives for private investment in urban and rural communities. These\nprograms have helped many communities to attract new private sector jobs\nand investments and to retain the jobs and investments that already are in\nplace.When I took office, the Federal government was spending less than $300\nmillion annually on economic development programs, and only $60 million of\nthose funds in our Nation's urban areas. Since that time, we have created\nthe Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) program and substantially\nexpanded the economic development programs in the Commerce Department. My\nFY 1982 budget requests more than $1.5 billion for economic development\ngrants, loans and interest subsidies and almost $1.5 billion for loan\nguarantees. Approximately 60 percent of these funds will be spent in our\nNation's urban areas. In addition, we have extended the 10 percent\ninvestment credit to include rehabilitation of existing industrial\nfacilities as well as new construction.I continue to believe that the development of private sector investment and\njobs is the key to revitalizing our Nation's economically depressed urban\nand rural areas. To ensure that the necessary economic development goes\nforward, the Congress must continue to provide strong support for the UDAG\nprogram and the programs for the Economic Development Administration. Those\nprograms provide a foundation for the economic development of our Nation in\nthe 1980's.COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENTThe partnership among Federal, State and local governments to revitalize\nour Nation's communities has been a high priority of my Administration.\nWhen I took office, I proposed a substantial expansion of the Community\nDevelopment Block Grant (CDBG) program and the enactment of a new $400\nmillion Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) program. Both of these\nprograms have provided essential community and economic development\nassistance to our Nation's cities and counties.Last year, Congress reauthorized both the CDBG and UDAG programs. The CDBG\nprogram was reauthorized for three more years with annual funding increases\nof $150 million, and the UDAG program was extended for three years at the\ncurrent funding level of $675 million annually. My 1982 budget requests\nfull funding for both of these programs. These actions should help our\nNation's cities and counties to continue the progress they have made in the\nlast three years.NEIGHBORHOODSDuring my Administration we have taken numerous positive steps to achieve a\nfull partnership of neighborhood organizations and government at all\nlevels. We have successfully fought against red lining and housing\ndiscrimination. We created innovative Self Help funding and technical\nresource transfer mechanisms. We have created unique methods of access for\nneighborhood organizations to have a participating role in Federal and\nState government decision-making. Neighborhood based organizations are the\nthreshold of the American community.The Federal government will need to develop more innovative and practical\nways for neighborhood based organizations to successfully participate in\nthe identification and solution of local and neighborhood concerns. Full\npartnership will only be achieved with the knowing participation of leaders\nof government, business, education and unions. Neither state nor Federal\nsolutions imposed from on high will suffice. Neighborhoods are the fabric\nand soul of this great land. Neighborhoods define the weave that has been\nused to create a permanent fabric. The Federal government must take every\nopportunity to provide access and influence to the individuals and\norganizations affected at the neighborhood level.Rural PolicySince the beginning of my Administration, I have been committed to\nimproving the effectiveness with which the Federal government deals with\nthe problems and needs of a rapidly changing rural America. The rapid\ngrowth of some rural areas has placed a heavy strain on communities and\ntheir resources. There are also persistent problems of poverty and economic\nstagnation in other parts of rural America. Some rural areas continue to\nlose population, as they have for the past several decades.In December, 1979, I announced the Small Community and Rural Development\nPolicy. It was the culmination of several years' work and was designed to\naddress the varying needs of our rural population. In 1980, my\nAdministration worked with the Congress to pass the Rural Development\nPolicy Act of 1980, which when fully implemented will allow us to meet the\nneeds of rural people and their communities more effectively and more\nefficiently.As a result of the policy and the accompanying legislation, we have:--Created the position of Under Secretary of Agriculture for Small\nCommunity and Rural Development to provide overall leadership.--Established a White House Working Group to assist in the implementation\nof the policy.--Worked with more than 40 governors to form State rural development\ncouncils to work in partnership with the White House Working Group, and the\nFederal agencies, to better deliver State and Federal programs to rural\nareas.--Directed the White House Working Group to annually review existing and\nproposed policies, programs, and budget levels to determine their adequacy\nin meeting rural needs and the fulfilling of the policy's objectives and\nprinciples.This effort on the part of my Administration and the Congress has resulted\nin a landmark policy. For the first time, rural affairs has received the\nprominence it has always deserved. It is a policy that can truly help\nalleviate the diverse and differing problems rural America will face in the\n1980's.With the help and dedication of a great many people around the country who\nare concerned with rural affairs, we have constructed a mechanism for\ndealing effectively with rural problems. There is now a great opportunity\nto successfully combine Federal efforts with the efforts of rural community\nleaders and residents. It is my hope this spirit of cooperation and record\nof accomplishment will be continued in the coming years.CONSUMERSIn September, 1979, I signed an Executive Order designed to strengthen and\ncoordinate Federal consumer programs and to establish procedures to improve\nand facilitate consumer participation in government decision-making. Forty\nFederal agencies have adopted programs to comply with the requirements of\nthe Order. These programs will improve complaint handling, provide better\ninformation to consumers, enhance opportunities for public participation in\ngovernment proceedings, and assure that the consumer point of view is\nconsidered in all programs, policies, and regulations.While substantial progress has been made in assuring a consumer presence in\nFederal agencies, work must continue to meet fully the goals of the\nExecutive Order. Close monitoring of agency compliance with the\nrequirements of the Order is necessary. Continued evaluation to assure that\nthe programs are effective and making maximum use of available resources is\nalso essential. As a complement to these initiatives, efforts to provide\nfinancial assistance in regulatory proceedings to citizen groups, small\nbusinesses, and others whose participation is limited by their economic\ncircumstances must continue to be pursued.It is essential that consumer representatives in government pay particular\nattention to the needs and interests of low-income consumers and\nminorities. The Office of Consumer Affairs' publication, \"People Power:\nWhat Communities Are Doing to Counter Inflation,\" catalogues some of the\nways that government and the private sector can assist the less powerful in\nour society to help themselves. New ways should be found to help foster\nthis new people's movement which is founded on the principle of\nself-reliance.Science and TechnologyScience and technology contribute immeasurably to the lives of all\nAmericans. Our high standard of living is largely the product of the\ntechnology that surrounds us in the home or factory. Our good health is due\nin large part to our ever increasing scientific understanding. Our national\nsecurity is assured by the application pate science and technology will\nbring.The Federal government has a special role to play in science and\ntechnology. Although the fruits of scientific achievements surround us, it\nis often difficult to predict the benefits that will arise from a given\nscientific venture. And these benefits, even if predictable, do not usually\nlead to ownership rights. Accordingly, the Government has a special\nobligation to support science as an investment in our future.My Administration has sought to reverse a decade-long decline in funding.\nDespite the need for fiscal restraint, real support of basic research has\ngrown nearly 11% during my term in office. And, my Administration has\nsought to increase the support of long-term research in the variety of\nmission agencies. In this way, we can harness the American genius for\ninnovation to meet the economic, energy, health, and security challenges\nthat confront our nation.--International Relations and National Security. Science and technology\nare becoming increasingly important elements of our national security and\nforeign policies. This is especially so in the current age of sophisticated\ndefense systems and of growing dependence among all countries on modern\ntechnology for all aspects of their economic strength. For these reasons,\nscientific and technological considerations have been integral elements of\nthe Administration's decision-making on such national security and foreign\npolicy issues as the modernization of our strategic weaponry, arms control,\ntechnology transfer, the growing bilateral relationship with China, and our\nrelations with the developing world.Four themes have shaped U.S. policy in international scientific and\ntechnological cooperation: pursuit of new international initiatives to\nadvance our own research and development objectives; development and\nstrengthening of scientific exchange to bridge politically ideological, and\ncultural divisions between this country and other countries; formulation of\nprograms and institutional relations to help developing countries use\nscience and technology beneficially; and cooperation with other nations to\nmanage technologies with local impact. At my direction, my Science and\nTechnology Adviser has actively pursued international programs in support\nof these four themes. We have given special attention to scientific and\ntechnical relations with China, to new forms of scientific and technical\ncooperation with Japan, to cooperation with Mexico, other Latin American\nand Caribbean countries and several states in Black America, and to the\nproposed Institute for Scientific and Technological Cooperation.In particular our cooperation with developing countries reflects the\nimportance that each of them has placed on the relationship between\neconomic growth and scientific and technological capability. It also\nreflects their view that the great strength of the U.S. in science and\ntechnology makes close relations with the U.S. technical community an\nespecially productive means of enhancing this capability. Scientific and\ntechnological assistance is a key linkage between the U.S. and the\ndeveloping world, a linkage that has been under-utilized in the past and\none which we must continue to work to strengthen.--Space Policy. The Administration has established a framework for a\nstrong and evolving space program for the 1980's.The Administration's space policy reaffirmed the separation of military\nspace systems and the open civil space program, and at the same time,\nprovided new guidance on technology transfer between the civil and military\nprograms. The civil space program centers on three basic tenets: First, our\nspace policy will reflect a balanced strategy of applications, science, and\ntechnology development. Second, activities will be pursued when they can be\nuniquely or more efficiently accomplished in space. Third, a premature\ncommitment to a high challenge, space-engineering initiative of the\ncomplexity of Apollo is inappropriate. As the Shuttle development phases\ndown, however, there will be added flexibility to consider new space\napplications, space science and new space exploration activities.--Technology Development. The Shuttle dominates our technology development\neffort and correctly so. It represents one of the most sophisticated\ntechnological challenges ever undertaken, and as a result, has encountered\ntechnical problems. Nonetheless, the first manned orbital flight is now\nscheduled for March, 1981. I have been pleased to support strongly the\nnecessary funds for the Shuttle throughout my Administration.--Space Applications. Since 1972, the U.S. has conducted experimental\ncivil remote sensing through Landsat satellites, thereby realizing many\nsuccessful applications. Recognizing this fact, I directed the\nimplementation of an operational civil land satellite remote sensing\nsystem, with the operational management responsibility in Commerce's\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In addition, because ocean\nobservations from space can meet common civil and military data\nrequirements, a National Oceanic Satellite System has been proposed as a\nmajor FY 1981 new start.--Space Science Exploration. The goals of this Administration's policy in\nspace science have been to: (1) continue a vigorous program of planetary\nexploration to understand the origin and evolution of the solar system; (2)\nutilize the space telescope and free-flying satellites to usher in a new\nera of astronomy; (3) develop a better understanding of the sun and its\ninteraction with the terrestrial environment; and (4) utilize the Shuttle\nand Spacelab to conduct basic research that complements earth-based life\nscience investigations.DISTRICT OF COLUMBIAWashington, D.C., is home to both the Federal Government and to more than\nhalf a million American citizens. I have worked to improve the relationship\nbetween the Federal establishment and the Government of the District of\nColumbia in order to further the goals and spirit of home rule. The City\ncontrols more of its own destiny than was the case four years ago. Yet,\ndespite the close cooperation between my Administration and that of Mayor\nBarry, we have not yet seen the necessary number of states ratify the\nConstitutional Amendment granting full voting representation in the\nCongress to the citizens of this city. It is my hope that this inequity\nwill be rectified. The country and the people who inhabit Washington\ndeserve no less.THE ARTSThe arts are a precious national resource.Federal support for the arts has been enhanced during my Administration by\nexpanding government funding and services to arts institutions, individual\nartists, scholars, and teachers through the National Endowment for the\nArts. We have broadened its scope and reach to a more diverse population.\nWe have also reactivated the Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities.It is my hope that during the coming years the new Administration and the\nCongress will:--Continue support of institutions promoting development and understanding\nof the arts;--Encourage business participants in a comprehensive effort to achieve a\ntruly mixed economy of support for the arts;--Explore a variety of mechanisms to nurture the creative talent of our\ncitizens and build audiences for their work;--Support strong, active National Endowments for the Arts;--Seek greater recognition for the rich cultural tradition of the nation's\nminorities;--Provide grants for the arts in low-income neighborhoods.THE HUMANITIESIn recently reauthorizing Federal appropriations for the National Endowment\nfor the Humanities, the Congress has once again reaffirmed that \"the\nencouragement and support of national progress and scholarship in the\nhumanities . . . while primarily a matter for private and local initiative,\nis also an appropriate matter of concern to the Federal Government\" and\nthat \"a high civilization must not limit its efforts to science and\ntechnology alone but must give full value and support to the other great\nbranches of man's scholarly and cultural activity in order to achieve a\nbetter understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a\nbetter view of the future.\"I believe we are in agreement that the humanities illuminate the values\nunderlying important personal, social, and national questions raised in our\nsociety by its multiple links to and increasing dependence on technology,\nand by the diverse heritage of our many regions and ethnic groups. The\nhumanities cast light on the broad issue of the role in a society of men\nand women of imagination and energy--those individuals who through their\nown example define \"the spirit of the age,\" and in so doing move nations.\nOur Government's support for the humanities, within the framework laid down\nby the Congress, is a recognition of their essential nourishment of the\nlife of the mind and vital enrichment of our national life.I will be proposing an increase in funding this year sufficient to enable\nthe Endowment to maintain the same level of support offered our citizens in\nFiscal Year 1981.In the allocation of this funding, special emphasis will be given to:--Humanities education in the nation's schools, in response to the great\nneeds that have arisen in this area;--Scholarly research designed to increase our understanding of the\ncultures, traditions, and historical forces at work in other nations and in\nour own;--Drawing attention to the physical disintegration of the raw material of\nour cultural heritage--books, manuscripts, periodicals, and other\ndocuments--and to the development of techniques to prevent the destruction\nand to preserve those materials; and--The dissemination of quality programming in the humanities to\nincreasingly large American audiences through the use of radio and\ntelevision.The dominant effort in the Endowment's expenditures will be a commitment to\nstrengthen and promulgate scholarly excellence and achievement in work in\nthe humanities in our schools, colleges, universities, libraries, museums\nand other cultural institutions, as well as in the work of individual\nscholars or collaborative groups engaged in advanced research in the\nhumanities.In making its grants the Endowment will increase its emphasis on techniques\nwhich stimulate support for the humanities from non-Federal sources, in\norder to reinforce our tradition of private philanthropy in this field, and\nto insure and expand the financial viability of our cultural institutions\nand life.INSULAR AREASI have been firmly committed to self-determination for Puerto Rico, the\nVirgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands, and\nhave vigorously supported the realization of whatever political status\naspirations are democratically chosen by their peoples. This principle was\nthe keystone of the comprehensive territorial policy I sent the Congress\nlast year. I am pleased that most of the legislative elements of that\npolicy were endorsed by the 96th Congress.The unique cultures, fragile economies, and locations of our Caribbean and\nPacific Islands are distinct assets to the United States which require the\nsensitive application of policy. The United States Government should pursue\ninitiatives begun by my Administration and the Congress to stimulate\ninsular economic development; enhance treatment under Federal programs\neliminating current inequities; provide vitally needed special assistance\nand coordinate and rationalize policies. These measures will result in\ngreater self-sufficiency and balanced growth. In particular, I hope that\nthe new Congress will support funding for fiscal management, comprehensive\nplanning and other technical assistance for the territories, as well as\ncreate the commission I have proposed to review the applicability of all\nFederal laws to the insular areas and make recommendations for appropriate\nmodification.IV. REMOVING GOVERNMENTAL WASTE AND INEFFICIENCYOne of my major commitments has been to restore public faith in our Federal\ngovernment by cutting out waste and inefficiency. In the past four years,\nwe have made dramatic advances toward this goal, many of them previously\nconsidered impossible to achieve. Where government rules and operations\nwere unnecessary, they have been eliminated, as with airline, rail,\ntrucking and financial deregulation. Where government functions are needed,\nthey have been streamlined, through such landmark measures as the Civil\nService Reform Act of 1978. I hope that the new administration and the\nCongress will keep up the momentum we have established for effective and\nresponsible change in this area of crucial public concern.CIVIL SERVICE REFORMIn March 1978, I submitted the Civil Service Reform Act to Congress. I\ncalled it the centerpiece of my efforts to reform and reorganize the\ngovernment. With bipartisan support from Congress, the bill passed, and I\nam pleased to say that implementation is running well ahead of the\nstatutory schedule. Throughout the service, we are putting into place the\nmeans to assure that reward and retention are based on performance and not\nsimply on length of time on the job. In the first real test of the Reform\nAct, 98 percent of the eligible top-level managers joined the Senior\nExecutive Service, choosing to relinquish job protections for the challenge\nand potential reward of this new corps of top executives. Though the Act\ndoes not require several of its key elements to be in operation for another\nyear, some Federal agencies already have established merit pay systems for\nGS-13-15 managers, and most agencies are well on their way to establishing\nnew performance standards for all their employees. All have paid out, or\nare now in the process of paying out, performance bonuses earned by\noutstanding members of the Senior Executive Service. Dismissals have\nincreased by 10 percent, and dismissals specifically for inadequate job\nperformance have risen 1500 percent, since the Act was adopted. Finally, we\nhave established a fully independent Merit Systems Protection Board and\nSpecial Counsel to protect the rights of whistle-blowers and other Federal\nemployees faced with threats to their rights.In 1981, civil service reform faces critical challenges, all agencies must\nhave fully functioning performance appraisal systems for all employees, and\nmerit pay systems for compensating the government's 130,000 GS-13-15\nmanagers. Performance bonuses for members of the Senior Executive Service\nwill surely receive scrutiny. If this attention is balanced and\nconstructive, it can only enhance the chances for ultimate success of our\nbipartisan commitment to the revolutionary and crucial \"pay for\nperformance\" concept.REGULATORY REFORMDuring the past four years we have made tremendous progress in regulatory\nreform. We have discarded old economic regulations that prevented\ncompetition and raised consumer costs, and we have imposed strong\nmanagement principles on the regulatory programs the country needs, cutting\npaperwork and other wasteful burdens. The challenge for the future is to\ncontinue the progress in both areas without crippling vital health and\nsafety programs.Our economic deregulation program has achieved major successes in five\nareas:Airlines: The Airline Deregulation Act is generating healthy competition,\nsaving billions in fares, and making the airlines more efficient. The Act\nprovides that in 1985 the CAB itself will go out of existence.Trucking: The trucking deregulation bill opens the industry to competition\nand allows truckers wide latitude on the routes they drive and the goods\nthey haul. The bill also phases out most of the old law's immunity for\nsetting rates. The Congressional Budget Office estimates these reforms will\nsave as much as $8 billion per year and cut as much as half a percentage\npoint from the inflation rate.Railroads: Overregulation has stifled railroad management initiative,\nservice, and competitive pricing. The new legislation gives the railroads\nthe freedom they need to rebuild a strong, efficient railroad industry.Financial Institutions: With the help of the Congress, over the past four\nyears we have achieved two major pieces of financial reform legislation,\nlegislation which has provided the basis for the most far-reaching changes\nin the financial services industry since the 1930's. The International\nBanking Act of 1978 was designed to reduce the advantages that foreign\nbanks operating in the United States possessed in comparison to domestic\nbanks. The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act,\nadopted last March, provides for the phased elimination of a variety of\nanti-competitive barriers to financial institutions and freedom to offer\nservices to and attract the savings of consumers, especially small savers.Recently, I submitted to the Congress my Administration's recommendations\nfor the phased liberalization of restrictions on geographic expansion by\ncommercial banks. Last year the Administration and financial regulatory\nagencies proposed legislation to permit the interstate acquisition of\nfailing depository institutions. In view of the difficult outlook for some\ndepository institutions I strongly urge the Congress to take prompt\nfavorable action on the failing bank legislation.Telecommunications: While Congress did not pass legislation in this area,\nthe Federal Communications Commission has taken dramatic action to open all\naspects of communications to competition and to eliminate regulations in\nthe areas where competition made them obsolete. The public is benefitting\nfrom an explosion of competition and new services.While these initiatives represent dramatic progress in economic\nderegulation, continued work is needed. I urge Congress to act on\ncommunications legislation and to consider other proposed deregulation\nmeasures, such as legislation on the bus industry. In addition, the\nregulatory commissions must maintain their commitment to competition as the\nbest regulator of all.The other part of my reform program covers the regulations that are needed\nto protect the health, safety, and welfare of our citizens. For these\nregulations, my Administration has created a management program to cut\ncosts without sacrificing goals. Under my Executive Order 12044, we\nrequired agencies to analyze the costs of their major new rules and\nconsider alternative approaches, such as performance standards and\nvoluntary codes, that may make rules less costly and more flexible. We\ncreated the Regulatory Analysis Review Group in the White House to analyze\nthe most costly proposed new rules and find ways to improve them. The\nRegulatory Council was established to provide the first Government-wide\nlisting of upcoming rules and eliminate overlapping and conflicting\nregulations. Agencies have launched \"sunset\" programs to weed out outmoded\nold regulations. We have acted to encourage public participation in\nregulatory decision-making.These steps have already saved billions of dollars in regulatory costs and\nslashed thousands of outmoded regulations. We are moving steadily toward a\nregulatory system that provides needed protections fairly, predictably, and\nat minimum cost.I urge Congress to continue on this steady path and resist the simplistic\nsolutions that have been proposed as alternatives. Proposals like\nlegislative veto and increased judicial review will add another layer to\nthe regulatory process, making it more cumbersome and inefficient. The\nright approach to reform is to improve the individual statutes, where they\nneed change, and to ensure that the regulatory agencies implement those\nstatutes sensibly.PAPERWORK REDUCTIONThe Federal Government imposes a huge paperwork burden on business, local\ngovernment, and the private sector. Many of these forms are needed for\nvital government functions, but others are duplicative, overly complex or\nobsolete.During my Administration we cut the paperwork burden by 15 percent, and we\ncreated procedures to continue this progress. The new Paperwork Reduction\nAct centralizes, in OMB, oversight of all agencies' information\nrequirements and strengthens OMB's authority to eliminate needless forms.\nThe \"paperwork budget\" process, which I established by executive order,\napplies the discipline of the budget process to the hours of reporting time\nimposed on the public, forcing agencies to scrutinize all their forms each\nyear. With effective implementation, these steps should allow further,\nsubstantial paperwork cuts in the years ahead.TIGHTENING STANDARDS FOR GOVERNMENTAL EFFICIENCY AND INTEGRITYTo develop a foundation to carry out energy policy, we consolidated\nscattered energy programs and launched the Synthetic Fuels Corporation; to\ngive education the priority it deserves and at the same time reduce HHS to\nmore manageable size, I gave education a seat at the Cabinet table, to\ncreate a stronger system for attacking waste and fraud, I reorganized audit\nand investigative functions by putting an Inspector General in major\nagencies. Since I took office, we have submitted 14 reorganization\ninitiatives and had them all approved by Congress. We have saved hundreds\nof millions of dollars through the adoption of businesslike cash management\nprinciples and set strict standards for personal financial disclosure and\nconflict of interest avoidance by high Federal officials.To streamline the structure of the government, we have secured approval of\n14 reorganization initiatives, improving the efficiency of the most\nimportant sectors of the government, including energy, education, and civil\nrights enforcement. We have eliminated more than 300 advisory committees as\nwell as other agencies, boards and commissions which were obsolete or\nineffective. Independent Inspectors General have been appointed in major\nagencies to attack fraud and waste. More than a billion dollars of\nquestionable transactions have been identified through their audit\nactivities.The adoption of business-like cash management and debt collection\ninitiatives will save over $1 billion, by streamlining the processing of\nreceipts, by controlling disbursements more carefully, and by reducing idle\ncash balances. Finally this Administration has set strict standards for\npersonal financial disclosure and conflict of interest avoidance by high\nFederal officials, to elevate the level of public trust in the government.V. PROTECTING BASIC RIGHTS AND LIBERTIESI am extremely proud of the advances we have made in ensuring equality and\nprotecting the basic freedoms of all Americans.--The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Office of\nFederal Contract Compliance (OFCCP) have been reorganized and strengthened\nand a permanent civil rights unit has been established in OMB.--To avoid fragmented, inconsistent and duplicative enforcement of civil\nrights laws, three agencies have been given coordinative and\nstandard-setting responsibilities in discrete areas: EEOC for all\nemployment-related activities, HUD for all those relating to housing, and\nthe Department of Justice for all other areas.--With the enactment of the Right to Financial Privacy Act and a bill\nlimiting police search of newsrooms, we have begun to establish a sound,\ncomprehensive, privacy program.Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment must be aggressively pursued.\nOnly one year remains in which to obtain ratification by three additional\nstates.The Congress must give early attention to a number of important bills which\nremain. These bills would:--strengthen the laws against discrimination in housing. Until it is\nenacted, the 1968 Civil Rights Act's promise of equal access to housing\nwill remain unfulfilled;--establish a charter for the FBI and the intelligence agencies. The\nfailure to define in law the duties and responsibilities of these agencies\nhas made possible some of the abuses which have occurred in recent years;--establish privacy safeguards for medical research, bank, insurance, and\ncredit records; and provide special protection for election fund transfer\nsystems.EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENTI remain committed as strongly as possible to the ratification of the Equal\nRights Amendment.As a result of our efforts in 1978, the Equal Rights Amendment's deadline\nfor ratification was extended for three years. We have now one year and\nthree States left. We cannot afford any delay in marshalling our resources\nand efforts to obtain the ratification of those three additional States.Although the Congress has no official role in the ratification process at\nthis point, you do have the ability to affect public opinion and the\nsupport of State Legislators for the Amendment. I urge Members from States\nwhich have not yet ratified the Equal Rights Amendment to use their\ninfluence to secure ratification. I will continue my own efforts to help\nensure ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led this Nation's effort to provide all its\ncitizens with civil rights and equal opportunities. His commitment to human\nrights, peace and non-violence stands as a monument to his humanity and\ncourage. As one of our Nation's most outstanding leaders, it is appropriate\nthat his birthday be commemorated as a national holiday. I hope the\nCongress will enact legislation this year that will achieve this goal.FAIR HOUSINGThe Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1980 passed the House of Representatives\nby an overwhelming bipartisan majority only to die in the Senate at the\nclose of the 96th Congress. The leaders of both parties have pledged to\nmake the enactment of fair housing legislation a top priority of the\nincoming Congress. The need is pressing and a strengthened federal\nenforcement effort must be the primary method of resolution.CRIMINAL CODEThe Federal criminal laws are often archaic, frequently contradictory and\nimprecise, and clearly in need of revision and codification. The new\nAdministration should continue the work which has been begun to develop a\nFederal criminal code which simplifies and clarifies our criminal laws,\nwhile maintaining our basic civil liberties and protections.PRIVACYAs our public and private institutions collect more and more information\nand as communications and computer technologies advance, we must act to\nprotect the personal privacy of our citizens.In the past four years we acted on the report of the Privacy Commission and\nestablished a national privacy policy. We worked with Congress to pass\nlegislation restricting wiretaps and law enforcement access to bank records\nand to reporters' files. We reduced the number of personal files held by\nthe government and restricted the transfer of personal information among\nFederal agencies. We also worked with the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development to establish international guidelines to\nprotect the privacy of personal information that is transferred across\nborders.VI. PROTECTING AND DEVELOPING OUR NATURAL RESOURCESTwo of our Nation's most precious natural resources are our environment and\nour vast agricultural capacity. From the beginning of my Administration, I\nhave worked with the Congress to enhance and protect, as well as develop\nour natural resources. In the environmental areas, I have been especially\nconcerned about the importance of balancing the need for resource\ndevelopment with preserving a clean environment, and have taken numerous\nactions to foster this goal. In the agricultural area, I have taken the\nsteps needed to improve farm incomes and to increase our agricultural\nproduction to record levels. That progress must be continued in the 1980's.ENVIRONMENTPreserving the quality of our environment has been among the most important\nobjectives of my Administration and of the Congress. As a result of these\nshared commitments and the dedicated efforts of many members of the\nCongress and my Administration, we have achieved several historic\naccomplishments.PROTECTION OF ALASKA LANDSPassage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act was one of\nthe most important conservation actions of this century. At stake was the\nfate of millions of acres of beautiful land, outstanding and unique\nwildlife populations, native cultures, and the opportunity to ensure that\nfuture generations of Americans would be able to enjoy the benefits of\nthese nationally significant resources. As a result of the leadership,\ncommitment, and persistence of my Administration and the Congressional\nleadership, the Alaska Lands Bill was signed into law last December.The Act adds 97 million acres of new parks and refuges, more than doubling\nthe size of our National Park and National Wildlife Refuge Systems. The\nbill triples the size of our national wilderness system, increasing its\nsize by 56 million acres. And by adding 25 free-flowing river segments to\nthe Wild and Scenic River System, the bill almost doubles the river mileage\nin that system. The Alaska Lands Act reaffirms our commitment to the\nenvironment and strikes a balance between protecting areas of great beauty\nand allowing development of Alaska's oil, gas, mineral, and timber\nresources.PROTECTION OF NATURAL RESOURCESIn addition to the Alaska Lands Act, over the past four years we have been\nable to expand significantly the national wilderness and parks systems. In\n1978, the Congress passed the historical Omnibus Parks Act, which made 12\nadditions to the National Park System. The Act also established the first\ntwo national trails since the National Trails System Act was passed in\n1968. Then, in 1980, as a result of my 1979 Environmental Message, the\nFederal land management agencies have established almost 300 new National\nRecreational Trails. With the completion of the RARE II process, which\neliminated the uncertainty surrounding the status of millions of acres of\nland, we called for over 15 million acres of new wilderness in the nation's\nNational Forest, in 1980 the Congress established about 4.5 million acres\nof wilderness in the lower 48 states. In addition, the Administration\nrecommended legislation to protect Lake Tahoe, and through an Executive\nOrder has already established a mechanism to help ensure the Lake's\nprotection. Finally, in 1980 the Administration established the Channel\nIslands Marine Sanctuary.Administration actions over the past four years stressed the importance of\nproviding Federal support only for water resource projects that are\neconomically and environmentally sound. This policy should have a major and\nlasting influence on the federal government's role in water resource\ndevelopment and management. The Administration's actions to recommend to\nthe Congress only economically and environmentally sound water resource\nprojects for funding resulted not only in our opposing uneconomic projects\nbut also, in 1979, in the first Administration proposal of new project\nstarts in 4 years.One of the most significant water policy actions of the past four years was\nthe Administration's June 6, 1978 Water Policy Reform Message to the\nCongress. This Message established a new national water resources policy\nwith the following objectives:--to give priority emphasis to water conservation;--to consider environmental requirements and values more fully and along\nwith economic factors in the planning and management of water projects and\nprograms;--to enhance cooperation between state and federal agencies in water\nresources planning and management.In addition, the Executive Office of the President established 11 policy\ndecision criteria to evaluate the proposed federal water projects, the\nWater Resources Council developed and adopted a new set of Principles and\nStandards for water projects which is binding on all federal construction\nagencies, and improved regulations were developed to implement the National\nHistoric Preservation Act and the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act. As a\nresult, water resource projects must be determined to be economically sound\nbefore the Administration will recommend authorization or appropriation.\nOver the years ahead, this policy will help to reduce wasteful federal\nspending by targeting federal funds to the highest priority water resource\nprojects.In the pursuit of this policy, however, we cannot lose projects. In the\npart that sound water resource projects play in providing irrigation,\npower, and flood control. We must also recognize the special needs of\nparticular regions of the country in evaluating the need for additional\nprojects.ADDRESSING GLOBAL RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMSThe Global 2000 Report to the President, prepared in response to my 1977\nEnvironment Message, is the first of its kind. Never before has our\ngovernment, or any government, taken such a comprehensive, long-range look\nat the interrelated global issues of resources, population, and\nenvironment.The Report's conclusions are important. They point to a rapid increase in\npopulation and human needs through the year 2000 while at the same time a\ndecline in the earth's capacity to meet those needs, unless nations of the\nworld act decisively to alter current trends.The United States has contributed actively to a series of U.N. conferences\non the environment, population, and resources, and is preparing for\nthe 1981 Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy. Following my\n1977 Environmental Message, the Administration development assistance\nprograms have added emphasis to natural resource management and\nenvironmental protection. My 1979 Environmental Message called attention to\nthe alarming loss of world forests, particularly in the tropics. An\ninteragency task force on tropical forests has developed a U.S. government\nprogram to encourage conservation and wise management of tropical forests.\nThe Administration is encouraging action by other nations and world\norganizations to the same purpose. The United States is a world leader in\nwildlife conservation and the assessment of environmental effects of\ngovernment actions. The January 5, 1979, Executive Order directing U.S.\ngovernment agencies to consider the effects of their major actions abroad,\nis another example of this leadership.COMMITMENT TO CONTROL OF POLLUTION AND HAZARDOUS CHEMICALSOver the past four years, there has been steady progress towards cleaner\nair and water, sustained by the commitment of Congress and the\nAdministration to these important national objectives. In addition, the\nAdministration has developed several new pollution compliance approaches\nsuch as alternative and innovative waste water treatment projects, the\n\"bubble\" concept, the \"offset\" policy, and permit consolidation, all of\nwhich are designed to reduce regulatory burdens on the private sector.One of the most pressing problems to come to light in the past four years\nhas been improper hazardous waste disposal. The Administration has moved on\nthree fronts. First, we proposed the Oil Hazardous Substances and Hazardous\nWaste Response, Liability and Compensation Act (the Superfund bill) to\nprovide comprehensive authority and $1.6 billion in funds to clean up\nabandoned hazardous waste disposal sites. In November 1980 the Congress\npassed a Superfund bill which I signed into law.Second, the administration established a hazardous waste enforcement strike\nforce to ensure that when available, responsible parties are required to\nclean up sites posing dangers to public health and to the environment. To\ndate, 50 lawsuits have been brought by the strike force.Third, regulations implementing subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and\nRecovery Act were issued. The regulations establish comprehensive controls\nfor hazardous waste and, together with vigorous enforcement, will help to\nensure that Love Canal will not be repeated.THE FUTUREFor the future, we cannot, and we must not, forget that we are charged with\nthe stewardship of an irreplaceable environment and natural heritage. Our\nchildren, and our children's children, are dependent upon our maintaining\nour commitment to preserving and enhancing the quality of our environment.\nIt is my hope that when our descendants look back on the 1980's they will\nbe able to affirm:--that we kept our commitment to the restoration of environmental\nquality;--that we protected the public health from the continuing dangers of toxic\nchemicals, from pollution, from hazardous and radioactive waste, and that\nwe made our communities safer, healthier and better places to live;--that we preserved America's wilderness areas and particularly its last\ngreat frontier, Alaska, for the benefit of all Americans in perpetuity;--that we put this nation on a path to a sustainable energy future, one\nbased increasingly on renewable resources and on energy conservation;--that we moved to protect America's countryside and coastland from\nmismanagement and irresponsibility;--that we redirected the management of the nation's water resources toward\nwater conservation, sound development and environmental protection;--that we faced squarely such worldwide problems as the destruction of\nforests, acid rain, carbon dioxide build-up and nuclear proliferation; and--that we protected the habitat and the existence of our own species on\nthis earth.AGRICULTURE THE FARM ECONOMYThe farm economy is sound and its future is bright. Agriculture remains a\nmajor bulwark of the nation's economy and an even more important factor in\nthe world food system. The demand for America's agricultural abundance,\nhere and abroad, continues to grow. In the near-term, the strength of this\ndemand is expected to press hard against supplies, resulting in continued\nprice strength.The health and vitality of current-day agriculture represents a significant\ndeparture from the situation that existed when I came to office four years\nago. In January 1977, the farm economy was in serious trouble. Farm prices\nand farm income were falling rapidly. Grain prices were at their lowest\nlevels in years and steadily falling. Livestock producers, in their fourth\nstraight year of record losses, were liquidating breeding herds at an\nunparalleled rate. Dairy farmers were losing money on every hundredweight\nof milk they produced. Sugar prices were in a nosedive.Through a combination of improvements in old, established programs and the\nadoption of new approaches where innovation and change were needed, my\nAdministration turned this situation around. Commodity prices have steadily\nrisen. Farm income turned upward. U.S. farm exports set new records each\nyear, increasing over 80 percent for the four year period. Livestock\nproducers began rebuilding their herds. Dairy farmers began to earn a\nprofit again.RECENT POLICY INITIATIVESSeveral major agricultural policy initiatives have been undertaken over the\npast year. Some are the culmination of policy proposals made earlier in\nthis Administration; others are measures taken to help farmers offset the\nimpact of rapid inflation in production costs. In combination, they\nrepresent a significant strengthening of our nation's food and agricultural\npolicy. These initiatives include:FOOD SECURITY RESERVEThe Congress authorized formation of a 4 million ton food grain reserve for\nuse in international food assistance. This reserve makes it possible for\nthe United States to stand behind its food aid commitment to food deficit\nnations, even during periods of short supplies and high prices. This\ncorrects a serious fault in our past food assistance policy.COMPREHENSIVE CROP INSURANCEThe Congress also authorized a significant new crop insurance program\nduring 1980. This measure provides farmers with an important new program\ntool for sharing the economic risks that are inherent to agriculture. When\nfully operational, it will replace a hodgepodge of disaster programs that\nsuffered from numerous shortcomings.SPECIAL LOAN RATESAnother legislative measure passed late in the 2nd session of the 96th\nCongress authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to provide higher loan\nrates to farmers who enter their grain in the farmer-owned grain reserve.\nThis additional incentive to participate will further strengthen the\nreserve.INCREASED LOAN PRICESIn July 1980, I administratively raised loan prices for wheat, feedgrains,\nand soybeans to help offset the effects of a serious cost-price squeeze. At\nthe same time, the release and call prices for the grain reserve were\nadjusted upward.HIGHER TARGET PRICESThe Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1980 raised the target prices for\n1980-crop wheat and feed grain crops. This change corrected for\nshortcomings in the adjustment formula contained in the Food and\nAgriculture Act of 1977.FUTURE AGENDAThe food and agricultural policies adopted by this Administration over the\npast four years, including those described above, will provide a firm\nfoundation for future governmental actions in this field. Expiration of the\nFood and Agriculture Act of 1977 later this year will require early\nattention by the Congress. With relatively minor changes, most of the\nauthorities contained in the 1977 Act should be extended in their present\nform. The farmer-owned grain reserve has proven to be a particularly\neffective means of stabilizing grain markets and should be preserved in\nessentially its present form.Beyond this, it will be important for the Congress to keep a close eye on\nprice-cost developments in the farm sector. As noted above, some of the\nactions I took last year were for the purpose of providing relief from the\ncost-price squeeze facing farmers. Should these pressures continue, further\nactions might be required.My Administration has devoted particular attention to the issues of world\nhunger, agricultural land use, and the future structure of American\nagriculture. I encourage the Congress and the next Administration to review\nthe results of these landmark enquiries and, where deemed appropriate, to\nact on their recommendations.Following a careful review of the situation, I recently extended the\nsuspension of grain sales to the Soviet Union. I am satisfied that this\naction has served its purpose effectively and fairly. However, as long as\nthis suspension must remain in effect, it will be important for the next\nAdministration and the Congress to take whatever actions are necessary to\nensure that the burden does not fall unfairly on our Nation's farmers. This\nhas been a key feature of my Administration's policy, and it should be\nmaintained.VII. FOREIGN POLICYFrom the time I assumed office four years ago this month, I have stressed\nthe need for this country to assert a leading role in a world undergoing\nthe most extensive and intensive change in human history.My policies have been directed in particular at three areas of change:--the steady growth and increased projection abroad of Soviet military\npower, power that has grown faster than our own over the past two decades.--the overwhelming dependence of Western nations, which now increasingly\nincludes the United States, on vital oil supplies from the Middle East.--the pressures of change in many nations of the developing world, in Iran\nand uncertainty about the future stability of many developing countries.As a result of those fundamental facts, we face some of the most serious\nchallenges in the history of this nation. The Soviet invasion of\nAfghanistan is a threat to global peace, to East-West relations, and to\nregional stable flow of oil. As the unprecedented relations, an and\noverwhelming vote in the General Assembly demonstrated, countries across\nthe world, and particularly the nonaligned, regard the Soviet invasion as a\nthreat to their independence and security. Turmoil within the region\nadjacent to the Persian Gulf poses risks for the security and prosperity of\nevery oil importing nation and thus for the entire global economy. The\ncontinuing holding of American hostages in Iran is both an affront to\ncivilized people everywhere, and a serious impediment to meeting the\nself-evident threat to widely-shared common interests, including those of\nIran.But as we focus our most urgent efforts on pressing problems, we will\ncontinue to pursue the benefits that only change can bring. For it always\nhas been the essence of America that we want to move on, we understand that\nprosperity, progress and most of all peace cannot be had by standing still.\nA world of nations striving to preserve their independence, and of peoples\naspiring for economic development and political freedom, is not a world\nhostile to the ideals and interests of the United States. We face powerful\nadversaries, but we have strong friends and dependable allies. We have\ncommon interests with the vast majority of the world's nations and\npeoples.There have been encouraging developments in recent years, as well as\nmatters requiring continued vigilance and concern:--Our alliances with the world's most advanced and democratic states from\nWestern Europe through Japan are stronger than ever.--We have helped to bring about a dramatic improvement in relations\nbetween Egypt and Israel and an historic step towards a comprehensive\nArab-Israeli settlement.--Our relations with China are growing closer, providing a major new\ndimension in our policy in Asia and the world.--Across southern Africa from Rhodesia to Namibia we are helping with the\npeaceful transition to majority rule in a context of respect for minority\nas well as majority rights.--We have worked domestically and with our allies to respond to an\nuncertain energy situation by conservation and diversification of energy\nsupplies based on internationally agreed targets.--We have unambiguously demonstrated our commitment to defend Western\ninterests in Southwest Asia, and we have significantly increased our\nability to do so.--And over the past four years the U.S. has developed an energy program\nwhich is comprehensive and ambitious. New institutions have been\nestablished such as the Synthetic Fuels Corporation and Solar Bank. Price\ndecontrol for oil and gas is proceeding. American consumers have risen to\nthe challenge, and we have experienced real improvements in consumption\npatterns.The central challenge for us today is to our steadfastedness of purpose. We\nare no longer tempted by isolationism. But we must also learn to deal\neffectively with the contradictions of the world, the need to cooperate\nwith potential adversaries without euphoria, without undermining our\ndetermination to compete with such adversaries and if necessary confront\nthe threats they may pose to our security.We face a broad range of threats and opportunities. We have and should\ncontinue to pursue a broad range of defense, diplomatic and economic\ncapabilities and objectives.I see six basic goals for America in the world over the 1980's:--First, we will continue, as we have over the past four years, to build\nAmerica's military strength and that of our allies and friends. Neither the\nSoviet Union nor any other nation will have reason to question our will to\nsustain the strongest and most flexible defense forces.--Second, we will pursue an active diplomacy in the world, working,\ntogether with our friends and allies, to resolve disputes through peaceful\nmeans and to make any aggressor pay a heavy price.--Third, we will strive to resolve pressing international economic\nproblems, particularly energy and inflation, and continue to pursue our\nstill larger objective of global economic growth through expanded trade and\ndevelopment assistance and through the preservation of an open multilateral\ntrading system.--Fourth, we will continue vigorously to support the process of building\ndemocratic institutions and improving human rights protection around the\nworld. We are deeply convinced that the future lies not with dictatorship\nbut democracy.--Fifth, we remain deeply committed to the process of mutual and\nverifiable arms control, particularly to the effort to prevent the spread\nand further development of nuclear weapons. Our decision to defer, but not\nabandon our efforts to secure ratification of the SALT II Treaty reflects\nour firm conviction that the United States has a profound national\nsecurity interest in the constraints on Soviet nuclear forces which only\nthat treaty can provide.--Sixth, we must continue to look ahead in order to evaluate and respond\nto resource, environment and population challenges through the end of this\ncentury.One very immediate and pressing objective that is uppermost on our minds\nand those of the American people is the release of our hostages in Iran.We have no basic quarrel with the nation, the revolution or the people\nof Iran. The threat to them comes not from American policy but from Soviet\nactions in the region. We are prepared to work with the government of Iran\nto develop a new and mutually beneficial relationship.But that will not be possible so long as Iran continues to hold Americans\nhostages, in defiance of the world community and civilized behavior. They\nmust be released unharmed. We have thus far pursued a measured program of\npeaceful diplomatic and economic steps in an attempt to resolve this issue\nwithout resorting to other remedies available to us under international\nlaw. This reflects the deep respect of our nation for the rule of law and\nfor the safety of our people being held, and our belief that a great power\nbears a responsibility to use its strength in a measured and judicious\nmanner. But our patience is not unlimited and our concern for the\nwell-being of our fellow citizens grows each day.ENHANCING NATIONAL SECURITY, AMERICAN MILITARY STRENGTHThe maintenance of national security is my first concern, as it has been\nfor every president before me.We must have both the military power and the political will to deter our\nadversaries and to support our friends and allies.We must pay whatever price is required to remain the strongest nation in\nthe world. That price has increased as the military power of our major\nadversary has grown and its readiness to use that power been made all too\nevident in Afghanistan. The real increases in defense spending, therefore\nprobably will be higher than previously projected; protecting our security\nmay require a larger share of our national wealth in the future.THE U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONSHIPWe are demonstrating to the Soviet Union across a broad front that it will\npay a heavy price for its aggression in terms of our relationship.\nThroughout the last decades U.S.-Soviet relations have been a mixture of\ncooperation and competition. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the\nimposition of a puppet government have highlighted in the starkest terms\nthe darker side of their policies, going well beyond competition and the\nlegitimate pursuit of national interest, and violating all norms of\ninternational law and practice.This attempt to subjugate an independent, non-aligned Islamic people is a\ncallous violation of international law and the United Nations Charter, two\nfundamentals of international order. Hence, it is also a dangerous threat\nto world peace. For the first time since the communization of Eastern\nEurope after World War II, the Soviets have sent combat forces into an area\nthat was not previously under their control, into a non-aligned and\nsovereign state.The destruction of the independence of the Afghanistan government and the\noccupation by the Soviet Union have altered the strategic situation in that\npart of the world in a very ominous fashion. It has significantly shortened\nthe striking distance to the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf for the\nSoviet Union.It has also eliminated a buffer between the Soviet Union and Pakistan and\npresented a new threat to Iran. These two countries are now far more\nvulnerable to Soviet political intimidation. If that intimidation were to\nprove effective, the Soviet Union could control an area of vital strategic\nand economic significance to the survival of Western Europe, the Far East,\nand ultimately the United States.It has now been over a year since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan dealt\na major blow to U.S.-Soviet relations and the entire international system.\nThe U.S. response has proven to be serious and far-reaching. It has been\nincreasingly effective, imposing real and sustained costs on the U.S.S.R.'s\neconomy and international image.Meanwhile, we have encouraged and supported efforts to reach a political\nsettlement in Afghanistan which would lead to a withdrawal of Soviet forces\nfrom that country and meet the interests of all concerned. It is Soviet\nintransigence that has kept those efforts from bearing fruit.Meanwhile, an overwhelming November resolution of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly on Afghanistan has again made clear that the world has not\nand will not forget Afghanistan. And our response continues to make it\nclear that Soviet use of force in pursuit of its international objectives\nis incompatible with the notion of business-as-usual.BILATERAL COMMUNICATIONU.S.-Soviet relations remain strained by the continued Soviet presence in\nAfghanistan, by growing Soviet military capabilities, and by the Soviets'\napparent willingness to use those capabilities without respect for the most\nbasic norms of international behavior.But the U.S.-Soviet relationship remains the single most important element\nin determining whether there will be war or peace. And so, despite serious\nstrains in our relations, we have maintained a dialogue with the Soviet\nUnion over the past year. Through this dialogue, we have ensured against\nbilateral misunderstandings and miscalculations which might escalate out of\ncontrol, and have managed to avoid the injection of superpower rivalries\ninto areas of tension like the Iran-Iraq conflict.POLANDNow, as was the case a year ago, the prospect of Soviet use of force\nthreatens the international order. The Soviet Union has completed\npreparations for a possible military intervention against Poland. Although\nthe situation in Poland has shown signs of stabilizing recently, Soviet\nforces remain in a high state of readiness and they could move into Poland\non short notice. We continue to believe that the Polish people should be\nallowed to work out their internal problems themselves, without outside\ninterference, and we have made clear to the Soviet leadership that any\nintervention in Poland would have severe and prolonged consequences for\nEast-West detente, and U.S.-Soviet relations in particular.DEFENSE BUDGETFor many years the Soviets have steadily increased their real defense\nspending, expanded their strategic forces, strengthened their forces in\nEurope and Asia, and enhanced their capability for projecting military\nforce around the world directly or through the use of proxies. Afghanistan\ndramatizes the vastly increased military power of the Soviet Union.The Soviet Union has built a war machine far beyond any reasonable\nrequirements for their own defense and security. In contrast, our own\ndefense spending declined in real terms every year from 1968 through 1976.We have reversed this decline in our own effort. Every year since 1976\nthere has been a real increase in our defense spending, and our lead has\nencouraged increases by our allies. With the support of the Congress, we\nmust and will make an even greater effort in the years ahead.The Fiscal Year 1982 budget would increase funding authority for defense to\nmore than $196 billion. This amount, together with a supplemental request\nfor FY 1981 of about $6 billion, will more than meet my Administration's\npledge for a sustained growth of 3 percent in real expenditures, and\nprovides for 5 percent in program growth in FY 1982 and beyond.The trends we mean to correct cannot be remedied overnight; we must be\nwilling to see this program through. To ensure that we do so I am setting a\ngrowth rate for defense that we can sustain over the long haul.The defense program I have proposed for the next five years will require\nsome sacrifice, but sacrifice we can well afford.The defense program emphasizes four areas:1. It ensures that our strategic nuclear forces will be equivalent to those\nof the Soviet Union and that deterrence against nuclear war will be\nmaintained; 2. It upgrades our forces so that the military balance between\nNATO and the Warsaw Pact will continue to deter the outbreak of war,\nconventional or nuclear, in Europe; 3. It provides us the ability to come\nquickly to the aid of friends and allies around the globe; 4. And it ensures\nthat our Navy will continue to be the most powerful on the seas.STRATEGIC FORCESWe are strengthening each of the three legs of our strategic forces. The\ncruise missile production which will begin next year will modernize our\nstrategic air deterrent. B-52 capabilities will also be improved. These\nsteps will maintain and enhance the B-52 fleet by improving its ability to\ndeliver weapons against increasingly heavily defended targets.We are also modernizing our strategic submarine force. Four more POSEIDON\nsubmarines backfitted with new, 4,000 mile TRIDENT I missiles began\ndeployments in 1980. Nine TRIDENT submarines have been authorized through\n1981, and we propose one more each year.The new M-X missile program to enhance our land-based intercontinental\nballistic missile force continues to make progress. Technical refinements\nin the basing design over the last year will result in operational\nbenefits, lower costs, and reduced environmental impact. The M-X program\ncontinues to be an essential ingredient in our strategic posture, providing\nsurvivability, endurance, secure command and control and the capability to\nthreaten targets the Soviets hold dear.Our new systems will enable U.S. strategic forces to maintain equivalence\nin the face of the mounting Soviet challenge. We would however need an even\ngreater investment in strategic systems to meet the likely Soviet buildup\nwithout SALT.STRATEGIC DOCTRINEThis Administration's systematic contributions to the necessary evolution\nof strategic doctrine began in 1977 when I commissioned a comprehensive net\nassessment. From that base a number of thorough investigations of specific\ntopics continued. I should emphasize that the need for an evolutionary\ndoctrine is driven not by any change in our basic objective, which remains\npeace and freedom for all mankind. Rather, the need for change is driven by\nthe inexorable buildup of Soviet military power and the increasing\npropensity of Soviet leaders to use this power in coercion and outright\naggression to impose their will on others.I have codified our evolving strategic doctrine in a number of interrelated\nand mutually supporting Presidential Directives. Their overarching theme is\nto provide a doctrinal basis, and the specific program to implement it,\nthat tells the world that no potential adversary of the United States could\never conclude that the fruits of his aggression would be significant or\nworth the enormous costs of our retaliation.The Presidential Directives include:PD-18: An overview of our strategic objectives PD-37: Basic space policy\nPD-41: Civil Defense PD-53: Survivability and endurance for\ntelecommunications PD-57: Mobilization planning PD-58: Continuity of\nGovernment PD-59: Countervailing Strategy for General War.These policies have been devised to deter, first and foremost, Soviet\naggression. As such they confront not only Soviet military forces but also\nSoviet military doctrine. By definition deterrence requires that we shape\nSoviet assessments about the risks of war, assessments they will make using\ntheir doctrine, not ours.But at the same time we in no way seek to emulate their doctrine. In\nparticular, nothing in our policy contemplates that nuclear warfare could\never be a deliberate instrument for achieving our own goals of peace and\nfreedom. Moreover, our policies are carefully devised to provide the\ngreatest possible incentives and opportunities for future progress in arms\ncontrol.Finally, our doctrinal evolution has been undertaken with appropriate\nconsultation with our NATO Allies and others. We are fully consistent with\nNATO's strategy of flexible response.FORCES FOR NATOWe are greatly accelerating our ability to reinforce Western Europe with\nmassive ground and air forces in a crisis. We are undertaking a major\nmodernization program for the Army's weapons and equipment, adding armor,\nfirepower, and tactical mobility.We are prepositioning more heavy equipment in Europe to help us cope with\nattacks with little warning, and greatly strengthening our airlift and\nsealift capabilities.We are also improving our tactical air forces, buying about 1700 new\nfighter and attack aircraft over the next five years, and increasing the\nnumber of Air Force fighter wings by over 10 percent.We are working closely with our European allies to secure the Host Nation\nSupport necessary to enable us to deploy more quickly a greater ratio of\ncombat forces to the European theater at a lower cost to the United\nStates.SECURITY ASSISTANCEAs we move to enhance U.S. defense capabilities, we must not lose sight of\nthe need to assist others in maintaining their own security and\nindependence. Events since World War II, most recently in Southwest Asia,\nhave amply demonstrated that U.S. security cannot exist in a vacuum, and\nthat our own prospects for peace are closely tied to those of our friends.\nThe security assistance programs which I am proposing for the coming fiscal\nyear thus directly promote vital U.S. foreign policy and national security\naims, and are integral parts of our efforts to improve and upgrade our own\nmilitary forces.More specifically, these programs, which are part of our overall foreign\naid request, promote U.S. security in two principal ways. First, they\nassist friendly and allied nations to develop the capability to defend\nthemselves and maintain their own independence. An example during this past\nyear was the timely support provided Thailand to help bolster that\ncountry's defenses against the large numbers of Soviet-backed Vietnamese\ntroops ranged along its eastern frontier. In addition, over the years these\nprograms have been important to the continued independence of other friends\nand allies such as Israel, Greece, Turkey and Korea. Second, security\nassistance constitutes an essential element in the broad cooperative\nrelationships we have established with many nations which permit either\nU.S. bases on their territory or access by U.S. forces to their facilities.\nThese programs have been particularly important with regard to the\nrecently-concluded access agreements with various countries in the Persian\nGulf and Indian Ocean regions and have been crucial to the protection of\nour interests throughout Southwest Asia.RAPID DEPLOYMENT FORCESWe are systematically enhancing our ability to respond rapidly to non-NATO\ncontingencies wherever required by our commitments or when our vital\ninterests are threatened.The rapid deployment forces we are assembling will be extraordinarily\nflexible: They could range in size from a few ships or air squadrons to\nformations as large as 100,000 men, together with their support. Our forces\nwill be prepared for rapid deployment to any region of strategic\nsignificance.Among the specific initiatives we are taking to help us respond to crises\noutside of Europe are:The development of a new fleet of large cargo aircraft with\nintercontinental range; the design and procurement of a force of Maritime\nPrepositioning Ships that will carry heavy equipment and supplies for three\nMarine Corps brigades; the procurement of fast sealift ships to move large\nquantities of men and material quickly from the U.S. to overseas areas of\ndeployment; increasing training and exercise activities to ensure that our\nforces will be well prepared to deploy and operate in distant areas.In addition, our European allies have agreed on the importance of providing\nsupport to U.S. deployments to Southwest Asia.NAVAL FORCESSeapower is indispensable to our global position, in peace and also in war.\nOur shipbuilding program will sustain a 550-ship Navy in the 1990's and we\nwill continue to build the most capable ships afloat.The program I have proposed will assure the ability of our Navy to operate\nin high threat areas, to maintain control of the seas and protect vital\nlines of communication, both military and economic and to provide the\nstrong maritime component of our rapid deployment forces. This is essential\nfor operations in remote areas of the world, where we cannot predict far in\nadvance the precise location of trouble, or preposition equipment on land.MILITARY PERSONNELNo matter how capable or advanced our weapons systems, our military\nsecurity depends on the abilities, the training and the dedication of the\npeople who serve in our armed forces. I am determined to recruit and to\nretain under any foreseeable circumstances an ample level of such skilled\nand experienced military personnel. This Administration has supported for\nFY 1981 the largest peacetime increase ever in military pay and\nallowances.We have enhanced our readiness and combat endurance by improving the\nReserve Components. All reservists are assigned to units structured to\ncomplement and provide needed depth to our active forces. Some reserve\npersonnel have also now been equipped with new equipment.MOBILIZATION PLANNINGWe have completed our first phase of mobilization planning, the first such\nPresidentially-directed effort since World War II. The government-wide\nexercise of our mobilization plans at the end of 1980 showed, first, that\nplanning pays off and, second, that much more needs to be done.OUR INTELLIGENCE POSTUREOur national interests are critically dependent on a strong and effective\nintelligence capability. We will maintain and strengthen the intelligence\ncapabilities needed to assure our national security. Maintenance of and\ncontinued improvements in our multi-faceted intelligence effort are\nessential if we are to cope successfully with the turbulence and\nuncertainties of today's world.The intelligence budget I have submitted to the Congress responds to our\nneeds in a responsible way, providing for significant growth over the\nFiscal Year 1981 budget. This growth will enable us to develop new\ntechnical means of intelligence collection while also assuring that the\nmore traditional methods of intelligence work are also given proper stress.\nWe must continue to integrate both modes of collection in our analyses.REGIONAL POLICIESEvery President for over three decades has recognized that America's\ninterests are global and that we must pursue a global foreign policy.Two world wars have made clear our stake in Western Europe and the North\nAtlantic area. We are also inextricably linked with the Far East,\npolitically, economically, and militarily. In both of these, the United\nStates has a permanent presence and security commitments which would be\nautomatically triggered. We have become increasingly conscious of our\ngrowing interests in a third area, the Middle East and the Persian Gulf\narea.We have vital stakes in other major regions of the world as well. We have\nlong recognized that in an era of interdependence, our own security and\nprosperity depend upon a larger common effort with friends and allies\nthroughout the world.THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCEIn recognition of the threat which the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan posed\nto Western interests in both Europe and Southwest Asia, NATO foreign and\ndefense ministers have expressed full support for U.S. efforts to develop a\ncapability to respond to a contingency in Southwest Asia and have approved\nan extensive program to help fill the gap which could be created by the\ndiversion of U.S. forces to that region.The U.S. has not been alone in seeking to maintain stability in the\nSouthwest Asia area and insure access to the needed resources there. The\nEuropean nations with the capability to do so are improving their own\nforces in the region and providing greater economic and political support\nto the residents of the area. In the face of the potential danger posed by\nthe Iran-Iraq conflict, we have developed coordination among the Western\nforces in the area of the Persian Gulf in order to be able to safeguard\npassage in that essential waterway.Concerning developments in and around Poland the allies have achieved the\nhighest level of cohesion and unity of purpose in making clear the effects\non future East-West relations of a precipitous Soviet act there.The alliance has continued to build on the progress of the past three years\nin improving its conventional forces through the Long-Term Defense Program.\nThough economic conditions throughout Europe today are making its\nachievement difficult, the yearly real increase of 3 percent in defense\nspending remains a goal actively sought by the alliance.The NATO alliance also has moved forward during the past year with the\nimplementation of its historic December 1979 decision to modernize its\nTheater Nuclear Force capabilities through deployment of improved Pershing\nballistic missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles in Europe. Our\nallies continue to cooperate actively with us in this important joint\nendeavor, whose purpose is to demonstrate convincingly to the Soviet Union\nthe potential costs of a nuclear conflict in Europe. At the same time, we\noffered convincing evidence of our commitment to arms control in Europe by\ninitiating preliminary consultations with the Soviet Union in Geneva on the\nsubject of negotiated limits on long-range theater nuclear forces. Also,\nduring 1980 we initiated and carried out a withdrawal from our nuclear\nweapons stockpile in Europe of 1,000 nuclear warheads. This successful\ndrawdown in our nuclear stockpile was a further tangible demonstration of\nour commitment to the updating of our existing theater nuclear forces in\nEurope.In the NATO area, we continued to work closely with other countries in\nproviding resources to help Turkey regain economic health. We regretted\nthat massive political and internal security problems led the Turkish\nmilitary to take over the government on September 12. The new Turkish\nauthorities are making some progress in resolving those problems, and they\nhave pledged an early return to civilian government. The tradition of the\nTurkish military gives us cause to take that pledge seriously. We welcomed\nthe reestablishment of Greece's links to the integrated military command\nstructure of the Atlantic Alliance--a move which we had strongly\nencouraged--as a major step toward strengthening NATO's vital southern\nflank at a time of international crisis and tension in adjacent areas.\nGreek reintegration exemplifies the importance which the allies place on\ncooperating in the common defense and shows that the allies can make the\ndifficult decisions necessary to insure their continued security. We also\nwelcomed the resumption of the intercommunal talks on Cyprus.THE U.S. AND THE PACIFIC NATIONSThe United States is a Pacific nation, as much as it is an Atlantic nation.\nOur interests in Asia are as important to us as our interests in Europe.\nOur trade with Asia is as great as our trade with Europe. During the past\nfour years we have regained a strong, dynamic and flexible posture for the\nUnited States in this vital region.Our major alliances with Japan, Australia and New Zealand are now stronger\nthan they ever have been, and together with the nations of western Europe,\nwe have begun to form the basic political structure for dealing with\ninternational crises that affect us all. Japan, Australia and New Zealand\nhave given us strong support in developing a strategy for responding to\ninstability in the Persian Gulf.Normalization of U.S. relations with China has facilitated China's full\nentry into the international community and encouraged a constructive\nChinese role in the Asia-Pacific region. Our relations with China have been\nrapidly consolidated over the past year through the conclusion of a series\nof bilateral agreements. We have established a pattern of frequent and\nfrank consultations between our two governments, exemplified by a series of\nhigh-level visits and by regular exchanges at the working level, through\nwhich we have been able to identify increasingly broad areas of common\ninterest on which we can cooperate.United States relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations\n(ASEAN) have also expanded dramatically in the past four years. ASEAN is\nnow the focus for U.S. policy in Southeast Asia, and its cohesion and\nstrength are essential to stability in this critical area and beyond.Soviet-supported Vietnamese aggression in Indo-china has posed a major\nchallenge to regional stability. In response, we have reiterated our\nsecurity commitment to Thailand and have provided emergency security\nassistance for Thai forces facing a Vietnamese military threat along the\nThai-Cambodian border. We have worked closely with ASEAN and the U.N. to\npress for withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia and to encourage a\npolitical settlement in Cambodia which permits that nation to be governed\nby leaders of its own choice. We still look forward to the day when\nCambodia peacefully can begin the process of rebuilding its social,\neconomic and political institutions, after years of devastation and\noccupation. And, on humanitarian grounds and in support of our friends in\nthe region, we have worked vigorously with international organizations to\narrange relief and resettlement for the exodus of Indo-chinese refugees\nwhich threatened to overwhelm these nations.We have maintained our alliance with Korea and helped assure Korea's\nsecurity during a difficult period of political transition.We have amended our military base agreement with the Philippines, ensuring\nstable access to these bases through 1991. The importance of our Philippine\nbases to the strategic flexibility of U.S. forces and our access to the\nIndian Ocean is self-evident.Finally, we are in the process of concluding a long negotiation\nestablishing Micronesia's status as a freely associated state.We enter the 1980's with a firm strategic footing in East Asia and the\nPacific, based on stable and productive U.S. relations with the majority of\ncountries of the region. We have established a stable level of U.S.\ninvolvement in the region, appropriate to our own interests and to the\ninterests of our friends and allies there.THE MIDDLE EAST AND SOUTHWEST ASIAThe continuing Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the dislocations caused\nby the Iraq-Iran war serve as constant reminders of the critical importance\nfor us, and our allies, of a third strategic zone stretching across the\nMiddle East, the Persian Gulf, and much of the Indian subcontinent. This\nSouthwest Asian region has served as a key strategic and commercial link\nbetween East and West over the centuries. Today it produces two-thirds of\nthe world's oil exports, providing most of the energy needs of our European\nallies and Japan. It has experienced almost continuous conflict between\nnations, internal instabilities in many countries, and regional rivalries,\ncombined with very rapid economic and social change. And now the Soviet\nUnion remains in occupation of one of these nations, ignoring world opinion\nwhich has called on it to get out.We have taken several measures to meet these challenges.MIDDLE EASTIn the Middle East, our determination to consolidate what has already been\nachieved in the peace process--and to buttress that accomplishment with\nfurther progress toward a comprehensive peace settlement--must remain a\ncentral goal of our foreign policy. Pursuant to their peace treaty, Egypt\nand Israel have made steady progress in the normalization of their\nrelations in a variety of fields, bringing the benefits of peace directly\nto their people. The new relationship between Egypt and Israel stands as an\nexample of peaceful cooperation in an increasingly fragmented and turbulent\nregion.Both President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin remain committed to the\ncurrent negotiations to provide full autonomy to the inhabitants of the\nWest Bank and Gaza. These negotiations have been complex and difficult, but\nthey have already made significant progress, and it is vital that the two\nsides, with our assistance, see the process through to a successful\nconclusion. We also recognize the need to broaden the peace process to\ninclude other parties to the conflict and believe that a successful\nautonomy agreement is an essential first step toward this objective.We have also taken a number of steps to strengthen our bilateral relations\nwith both Israel and Egypt. We share important strategic interests with\nboth of these countries.We remain committed to Israel's security and are prepared to take concrete\nsteps to support Israel whenever that security is threatened.PERSIAN GULFThe Persian Gulf has been a vital crossroads for trade between Europe and\nAsia at many key moments in history. It has become essential in recent\nyears for its supply of oil to the United States, our allies, and our\nfriends. We have taken effective measures to control our own consumption of\nimported fuel, working in cooperation with the other key industrial /\nnations of the world. However, there is little doubt that the healthy\ngrowth of our American and world economies will depend for many years on\ncontinued safe access to the Persian Gulf's oil production. The denial of\nthese oil supplies would threaten not only our own but world security.The potent new threat from an advancing Soviet Union, against the\nbackground of regional instability of which it can take advantage, requires\nthat we reinforce our ability to defend our regional friends and to protect\nthe flow of oil. We are continuing to build on the strong political,\neconomic, social and humanitarian ties which bind this government and the\nAmerican people to friendly governments and peoples of the Persian Gulf.We have also embarked on a course to reinforce the trust and confidence our\nregional friends have in our ability to come to their assistance rapidly\nwith American military force if needed. We have increased our naval\npresence in the Indian Ocean. We have created a Rapid Deployment Force\nwhich can move quickly to the Gulf--or indeed any other area of the world\nwhere outside aggression threatens. We have concluded several agreements\nwith countries which are prepared to let us use their airports and naval\nfacilities in an emergency. We have met requests for reasonable amounts of\nAmerican weaponry from regional countries which are anxious to defend\nthemselves. And we are discussing with a number of our area friends further\nways we can help to improve their security and ours, both for the short and\nthe longer term.SOUTH ASIAWe seek a South Asia comprising sovereign and stable states, free of\noutside interference, which can strengthen their political institutions\naccording to their own national genius and can develop their economies for\nthe betterment of their people.The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has posed a new challenge to this\nregion, and particularly to neighboring Pakistan. We are engaged in a\ncontinuing dialogue with the Pakistan government concerning its development\nand security requirements and the economic burden imposed by Afghan\nrefugees who have fled to Pakistan. We are participating with other aid\nconsortium members in debt rescheduling and will continue to cooperate\nthrough the UNHCR in providing refugee assistance. We remain committed to\nPakistan's territorial integrity and independence.Developments in the broad South/Southwest Asian region have also lent a new\nimportance to our relations with India, the largest and strongest power in\nthe area. We share India's interest in a more constructive relationship.\nIndian policies and perceptions at times differ from our own, and we have\nestablished a candid dialogue with this sister democracy which seeks to\navoid the misunderstandings which have sometimes complicated our ties.We attach major importance to strong economic assistance programs to the\ncountries in the area, which include a majority of the poor of the\nnon-Communist world. We believe that these programs will help achieve\nstability in the area, an objective we share with the countries in the\nregion. Great progress has been achieved by these countries in increasing\nfood production; international cooperation in harnessing the great river\nresources of South Asia would contribute further to this goal and help to\nincrease energy production.We continue to give high priority to our non-proliferation goals in the\narea in the context of our broad global and regional priorities. The\ndecision to continue supply of nuclear fuel to the Indian Tarapur reactors\nwas sensitive to this effort.AFRICAThe United States has achieved a new level of trust and cooperation with\nAfrica. Our efforts, together with our allies, to achieve peace in southern\nAfrica, our increased efforts to help the poorest countries in Africa to\ncombat poverty, and our expanded efforts to promote trade and investment\nhave led to growing respect for the U.S. and to cooperation in areas of\nvital interest to the United States.Africa is a continent of poor nations for the most part. It also contains\nmany of the mineral resources vital for our economy. We have worked with\nAfrica in a spirit of mutual cooperation to help the African nations solve\ntheir problems of poverty and to develop stronger ties between our private\nsector and African economies. Our assistance to Africa has more than\ndoubled in the last four years. Equally important, we set in motion new\nmechanisms for private investment and trade.Nigeria is the largest country in Black Africa and the second largest oil\nsupplier to the United States. During this Administration we have greatly\nexpanded and improved our relationship with Nigeria and other West African\nstates whose aspirations for a constitutional democratic order we share and\nsupport. This interest was manifested both symbolically and practically by\nthe visit of Vice President Mondale to West Africa in July (1980) and the\nsuccessful visit to Washington of the President of Nigeria in October.During Vice President Mondale's visit, a Joint Agricultural Consultative\nCommittee was established, with the U.S. represented entirely by the\nprivate sector. This could herald a new role for the American private\nsector in helping solve the world's serious food shortages. I am pleased to\nsay that our relations with Nigeria are at an all-time high, providing the\nfoundation for an even stronger relationship in the years ahead.Another tenet of this Administration's approach to African problems has\nbeen encouragement and support for regional solutions to Africa's\nproblems. We have supported initiatives by the Organization of African\nUnity to solve the protracted conflict in the western Sahara, Chad, and the\nHorn. In Chad, the world is watching with dismay as a country torn by a\ndevastating civil war has become a fertile field for Libya's exploitation,\nthus demonstrating that threats to peace can come from forces within as\nwell as without Africa.In southern Africa the United States continues to pursue a policy of\nencouraging peaceful development toward majority rule. In 1980, Southern\nRhodesia became independent as Zimbabwe, a multiracial nation under a\nsystem of majority rule. Zimbabwean independence last April was the\nculmination of a long struggle within the country and diplomatic efforts\ninvolving Great Britain, African states neighboring Zimbabwe, and the\nUnited States.The focus of our efforts in pursuit of majority rule in southern Africa has\nnow turned to Namibia. Negotiations are proceeding among concerned parties\nunder the leadership of U.N. Secretary General Waldheim. This should lead\nto implementation of the U.N. plan for self-determination and independence\nfor Namibia during 1981. If these negotiations are successfully concluded,\nsixty-five years of uncertainty over the status of the territory, including\na seven-year-long war, will be ended.In response to our active concern with issues of importance to Africans,\nAfrican states have cooperated with us on issues of importance to our\nnational interests. African states voted overwhelmingly in favor of the\nU.N. Resolution calling for release of the hostages, and for the U.N.\nResolution condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Two countries of\nAfrica have signed access agreements with the U.S. allowing us use of naval\nand air facilities in the Indian Ocean.Africans have become increasingly vocal on human rights. African leaders\nhave spoken out on the issue of political prisoners, and the OAU is\ndrafting its own Charter on Human Rights. Three countries in Africa--\nNigeria, Ghana, and Uganda--have returned to civilian rule during the past\nyear.U.S. cooperation with Africa on all these matters represents a strong base\non which we can build in future years.Liberia is a country of long-standing ties with the U.S. and the site of\nconsiderable U.S. investment and facilities. This past April a coup\nreplaced the government and a period of political and economic uncertainty\nensued. The U.S. acted swiftly to meet this situation. We, together with\nAfrican leaders, urged the release of political prisoners, and many have\nbeen released; we provided emergency economic assistance to help avoid\neconomic collapse, and helped to involve the IMF and the banking community\nto bring about economic stability; and we have worked closely with the new\nleaders to maintain Liberia's strong ties with the West and to protect\nAmerica's vital interests.NORTH AFRICAIn early 1979, following a Libyan-inspired commando attack on a Tunisian\nprovincial city, the U.S. responded promptly to Tunisia's urgent request\nfor assistance, both by airlifting needed military equipment and by making\nclear our longstanding interest in the security and integrity of this\nfriendly country. The U.S. remains determined to oppose other irresponsible\nLibyan aspirations. Despairing of a productive dialogue with the Libyan\nauthorities, the U.S. closed down its embassy in Libya and later expelled\nsix Libyan diplomats in Washington in order to deter an intimidation\ncampaign against Libyan citizens in the U.S.U.S. relations with Algeria have improved, and Algeria has played an\nindispensable and effective role as intermediary between Iran and the U.S.\nover the hostage issue.The strengthening of our arms supply relationship with Morocco has helped\nto deal with attacks inside its internationally recognized frontiers and to\nstrengthen its confidence in seeking a political settlement of the Western\nSahara conflict. While not assuming a mediatory role, the U.S. encouraged\nall interested parties to turn their energies to a peaceful and sensible\ncompromise resolution of the war in the Sahara and supported efforts by the\nOrganization of African Unity toward that end. As the year drew to a close,\nthe U.S. was encouraged by evolution in the attitudes of all sides, and is\nhopeful that their differences will be peacefully resolved in the year\nahead so that the vast economic potential of North Africa can be developed\nfor the well-being of the people living there.LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEANThe principles of our policies in this hemisphere have been clear and\nconstant over the last four years. We support democracy and respect for\nhuman rights. We have struggled with many to help free the region of both\nrepression and terrorism. We have respected ideological diversity and\nopposed outside intervention in purely internal affairs. We will act,\nthough, in response to a request for assistance by a country threatened by\nexternal aggression. We support social and economic development within a\ndemocratic framework. We support the peaceful settlement of disputes. We\nstrongly encourage regional cooperation and shared responsibilities within\nthe hemisphere to all these ends, and we have eagerly and regularly sought\nthe advice of the leaders of the region on a wide range of issues.Last November, I spoke to the General Assembly of the Organization of\nAmerican States of a cause that has been closest to my heart--human\nrights. It is an issue that has found its time in the hemisphere. The cause\nis not mine alone, but an historic movement that will endure.At Riobamba, Ecuador, last September four Andean Pact countries, Costa\nRica, and Panama broke new ground by adopting a \"Code of Conduct,\" that\njoint action in defense of human rights does not violate the principles of\nnonintervention in the internal affairs of states in this hemisphere. The\nOrganization of American States has twice condemned the coup that\noverturned the democratic process in Bolivia and the widespread abuse of\nhuman rights by the regime which seized power. The Inter-American\nCommission on Human Rights has gained world acclaim for its dispassionate\nreports. It completed two major country studies this year in addition to\nits annual report. In a resolution adopted without opposition, the OAS\nGeneral Assembly in November strongly supported the work of the Commission.\nThe American Convention on Human Rights is in force and an Inter-American\nCourt has been created to judge human rights violations. This convention\nhas been pending before the Senate for two years; I hope the United States\nthis year will join the other nations of the hemisphere in ratifying a\nconvention which embodies principles that are our tradition.The trend in favor of democracy has continued. During this past year, Peru\ninaugurated a democratically elected government. Brazil continues its\nprocess of liberalization. In Central America, Hondurans voted in record\nnumbers in their first national elections in over eight years. In the\nCaribbean seven elections have returned governments firmly committed to the\ndemocratic traditions of the Commonwealth.Another major contribution to peace in the hemisphere is Latin America's\nown Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. On behalf of the United\nStates, I signed Protocol I of this Treaty in May of 1977 and sent it to\nthe Senate for ratification. I urge that it be acted upon promptly by the\nSenate in order that it be brought into the widest possible effect in the\nLatin American region.Regional cooperation for development is gaining from Central America to the\nAndes, and throughout the Caribbean. The Caribbean Group for Cooperation in\nEconomic Development, which we established with 29 other nations in 1977,\nhas helped channel $750 million in external support for growth in the\nCaribbean. The recent meeting of the Chiefs of State of the Eastern\nCaribbean set a new precedent for cooperation in that region. Mexico and\nVenezuela jointly and Trinidad and Tobago separately have established oil\nfacilities that will provide substantial assistance to their oil importing\nneighbors. The peace treaty between El Salvador and Honduras will hopefully\nstimulate Central America to move forward again toward economic\nintegration. Formation of Caribbean/ Central American Action, a private\nsector organization, has given a major impetus to improving\npeople-to-people bonds and strengthening the role of private enterprise in\nthe development of democratic societies.The Panama treaties have been in force for over a year. A new partnership\nhas been created with Panama; it is a model for large and small nations. A\nlongstanding issue that divided us from our neighbors has been resolved.\nThe security of the canal has been enhanced. The canal is operating as well\nas ever, with traffic through it reaching record levels this year. Canal\nemployees, American and Panamanian alike, have remained on the job and have\nfound their living and working conditions virtually unchanged.In 1980, relations with Mexico continued to improve due in large measure to\nthe effectiveness of the Coordinator for Mexican Affairs and the expanded\nuse of the U.S.-Mexico Consultative Mechanism. By holding periodic meetings\nof its various working groups, we have been able to prevent mutual concerns\nfrom becoming political issues. The Secretary of State visited Mexico City\nin November, and, along with the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations,\nreviewed the performance of the Consultative Mechanism. The office of the\nCoordinator has ensured the implementation of my directive to all agencies\nto accord high priority to Mexican concerns. Trade with Mexico rose by\nalmost 60 percent to nearly $30 billion, making that country our third\nlargest trading partner.These are all encouraging developments. Other problems remain, however.The impact of large-scale migration is affecting many countries in the\nhemisphere. The most serious manifestation was the massive, illegal exodus\nfrom Cuba last summer. The Cuban government unilaterally encouraged the\ndisorderly and even deadly migration of 125,000 of its citizens in complete\ndisregard for international law or the immigration laws of its neighbors.\nMigrations of this nature clearly require concerted action, and we have\nasked the OAS to explore means of dealing with similar situations which may\noccur in the future.We have a long-standing treaty with Colombia on Quita Sueno, Roncador, and\nSerrano which remains to be ratified by the Senate.In Central America, the future of Nicaragua is unclear. Recent tensions,\nthe restrictions on the press and political activity, an inordinate Cuban\npresence in the country and the tragic killing by the security forces of a\nbusinessman well known for his democratic orientation, cause us\nconsiderable concern. These are not encouraging developments. But those who\nseek a free society remain in the contest for their nation's destiny. They\nhave asked us to help rebuild their country, and by our assistance, to\ndemonstrate that the democratic nations do not intend to abandon Nicaragua\nto the Cubans. As long as those who intend to pursue their pluralistic\ngoals play important roles in Nicaragua, it deserves our continuing\nsupport.In El Salvador, we have supported the efforts of the Junta to change the\nfundamental basis of an inequitable system and to give a stake in a new\nnation to those millions of people, who for so long, lived without hope or\ndignity. As the government struggles against those who would restore an old\ntyranny or impose a new one, the United States will continue to stand\nbehind them.We have increased our aid to the Caribbean, an area vital to our national\nsecurity, and we should continue to build close relations based on mutual\nrespect and understanding, and common interests.As the nations of this hemisphere prepare to move further into the 1980's,\nI am struck by the depth of underlying commitment that there is to our\ncommon principles: non-intervention, peaceful settlement of disputes,\ncooperation for development, democracy and defense of basic human rights. I\nleave office satisfied that the political, economic, social and\norganizational basis for further progress with respect to all these\nprinciples have been substantially strengthened in the past four years. I\nam particularly reassured by the leadership by other nations of the\nhemisphere in advancing these principles. The success of our common task of\nimproving the circumstances of all peoples and nations in the hemisphere\ncan only be assured by the sharing of responsibility. I look forward to a\nhemisphere that at the end of this decade has proven itself anew as a\nleader in the promotion of both national and human dignity.THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMYA growing defense effort and a vigorous foreign policy rest upon a strong\neconomy here in the United States. And the strength of our own economy\ndepends upon our ability to lead and compete in the international\nmarketplace.ENERGYLast year, the war between Iraq and Iran led to the loss of nearly 4\nmillion barrels of oil to world markets, the third major oil market\ndisruption in the past seven years. This crisis has vividly demonstrated\nonce again both the value of lessened dependence on oil imports and the\ncontinuing instability of the Persian Gulf area.Under the leadership of the United States, the 21 members of the\nInternational Energy Agency took collective action to ensure that the oil\nshortfall stemming from the Iran-Iraq war would not be aggravated by\ncompetition for scarce spot market supplies. We are also working together\nto see that those nations most seriously affected by the oil disruption--\nincluding our key NATO allies Turkey and Portugal--can get the oil they\nneed. At the most recent IEA Ministerial meeting we joined the other\nmembers in pledging to take those policy measures necessary to slice our\njoint oil imports in the first quarter of 1981 by 2.2 million barrels.Our international cooperation efforts in the energy field are not limited\nto crisis management. At the Economic Summit meetings in Tokyo and Venice,\nthe heads of government of the seven major industrial democracies agreed to\na series of tough energy conservation and production goals. We are working\ntogether with all our allies and friends in this effort.Construction has begun on a commercial scale coal liquefaction plant in\nWest Virginia co-financed by the United States, Japan and West Germany. An\ninteragency task force has just reported to me on a series of measures we\nneed to take to increase coal production and exports. This report builds on\nthe work of the International Energy Agency's Coal Industry Advisory Board.\nWith the assurances of a reliable United States steam coal supply at\nreasonable prices, many of the electric power plants to be built in the\n1980's and 1990's can be coal-fired rather than oil-burning.We are working cooperatively with other nations to increase energy security\nin other areas as well. Joint research and development with our allies is\nunderway in solar energy, nuclear power, industrial conservation and other\nareas. In addition, we are assisting rapidly industrializing nations to\ncarefully assess their basic energy policy choices, and our development\nassistance program helps the developing countries to increase indigenous\nenergy production to meet the energy needs of their poorest citizens. We\nsupport the proposal for a new World Bank energy affiliate to these same\nends, whose fulfillment will contribute to a better global balance between\nenergy supply and demand.INTERNATIONAL MONETARY POLICYDespite the rapid increase in oil costs, the policy measures we have taken\nto improve domestic economic performance have had a continued powerful\neffect on our external accounts and on the strength of the dollar. A strong\ndollar helps in the fight against inflation.There has also been considerable forward movement in efforts to improve the\nfunctioning of the international monetary system. The stability of the\ninternational system of payments and trade is important to the stability\nand good health of our own economy. We have given strong support to the\ninnovative steps being taken by the International Monetary Fund and World\nBank to help promote early adjustment to the difficult international\neconomic problems. Recent agreement to increase quotas by fifty percent\nwill ensure the IMF has sufficient resources to perform its central role in\npromoting adjustment and financing payments imbalances. The World Bank's\nnew structural adjustment lending program will also make an important\ncontribution to international efforts to help countries achieve a\nsustainable level of growth and development.SUGARIn 1980, Congress passed U.S. implementing legislation for the\nInternational Sugar Agreement, thus fulfilling a major commitment of this\nAdministration. The agreement is an important element in our international\ncommodity policy with far-reaching implications for our relations with\ndeveloping countries, particularly sugar producers in Latin America.\nProducers and consumers alike will benefit from a more stable market for\nthis essential commodity.COFFEEAt year's end, Congress approved implementing legislation permitting the\nU.S. to carry out fully its commitments under International Coffee\nAgreement Specifically, the legislation enables us to meet our part of an\nunderstanding negotiated last fall among members of the Agreement, which\ndefends, by use of export quotas, a price range well below coffee prices of\nprevious years and which commits major coffee producers to eliminate cartel\narrangements that manipulated future markets to raise prices. The way is\nnow open to a fully-functioning International Coffee Agreement which can\nhelp to stabilize this major world commodity market. The results will be\npositive for both consumers--who will be less likely to suffer from sharp\nincreases in coffee prices--and producers--who can undertake future\ninvestment with assurance of greater protection against disruptive price\nfluctuations in their exports.NATURAL RUBBERIn 1980, the International Natural Rubber Agreement entered into force\nprovisionally. U.S. membership in this new body was approved overwhelmingly\nby the Senate last year. The natural rubber agreement is a model of its\nkind and should make a substantial contribution to a stable world market in\nthis key industrial commodity. It is thus an excellent example of\nconstructive steps to improve the operation of the world economy in ways\nwhich can benefit the developing and industrialized countries alike. In\nparticular, the agreement has improved important U.S. relationships with\nthe major natural rubber-producing countries of Southeast Asia.COMMON FUNDThe United States joined members of the United Nations Conference on Trade\nand Development, both developed and developing nations, in concluding\nArticles of Agreement in 1980 for a Common Fund to help international\ncommodity agreements stabilize the prices of raw materials.ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH DEVELOPING NATIONSOur relations with the developing nations are of major importance to the\nUnited States. The fabric of our relations with these countries has strong\neconomic and political dimensions. They constitute the most rapidly growing\nmarkets for our exports, and are important sources of fuel and raw\nmaterials. Their political views are increasingly important, as\ndemonstrated in their overwhelming condemnation of the Soviet invasion of\nAfghanistan. Our ability to work together with developing nations toward\ngoals we have in common (their political independence, the resolution of\nregional tensions, and our growing ties of trade for example) require us to\nmaintain the policy of active involvement with the developing world that we\nhave pursued over the past four years.The actions we have taken in such areas as energy, trade, commodities, and\ninternational financial institutions are all important to the welfare of\nthe developing countries. Another important way the United States can\ndirectly assist these countries and demonstrate our concern for their\nfuture is through our multilateral and bilateral foreign assistance\nprogram. The legislation which I will be submitting to you for FY 82\nprovides the authority and the funds to carry on this activity. Prompt\nCongressional action on this legislation is essential in order to attack\nsuch high priority global problems as food and energy, meet our treaty and\nbase rights agreements, continue our peace efforts in the Middle East,\nprovide economic and development support to countries in need, promote\nprogress on North-South issues, protect Western interests, and counter\nSoviet influence.Our proposed FY 1982 bilateral development aid program is directly\nresponsive to the agreement reached at the 1980 Venice Economic Summit that\nthe major industrial nations should increase their aid for food and energy\nproduction and for family planning. We understand that other Summit\ncountries plan similar responses. It is also important to honor our\ninternational agreements for multilateral assistance by authorizing and\nappropriating funds for the International Financial Institutions. These\nmultilateral programs enhance the efficiency of U.S. contributions by\ncombining them with those of many other donor countries to promote\ndevelopment; the proposed new World Bank affiliate to increase energy\noutput in developing countries offers particular promise. All these types\nof aid benefit our long-run economic and political interests.Progress was made on a number of economic issues in negotiations throughout\nthe U.N. system. However, in spite of lengthy efforts in the United\nNations, agreement has not been reached on how to launch a process of\nGlobal Negotiations in which nations might collectively work to solve such\nimportant issues as energy, food, protectionism, and population pressures.\nThe United States continues to believe that progress can best be made when\nnations focus on such specific problems, rather than on procedural and\ninstitutional questions. It will continue to work to move the North-South\ndialogue into a more constructive phase.FOOD--THE WAR ON HUNGERThe War on Hunger must be a continuous urgent priority. Major portions of\nthe world's population continue to be threatened by the specter of hunger\nand malnutrition. During the past year, some 150 million people in 36\nAfrican countries were faced with near disaster as the result of serious\ndrought, induced food shortages. Our government, working in concert with\nthe U.N.'s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), helped to respond to\nthat need. But the problems of hunger cannot be solved by short-term\nmeasures. We must continue to support those activities, bilateral and\nmultilateral, which aim at improving food production especially in\ndeveloping countries and assuring global food security. These measures are\nnecessary to the maintenance of a stable and healthy world economy.I am pleased that negotiation of a new Food Aid Convention, which\nguarantees a minimum annual level of food assistance, was successfully\nconcluded in March. The establishment of the International Emergency Wheat\nReserve will enable the U.S. to meet its commitment under the new\nConvention to feed hungry people, even in times of short supply.Of immediate concern is the prospect of millions of Africans threatened by\nfamine because of drought and civil disturbances. The U.S. plea for\nincreased food aid resulted in the organization of an international\npledging conference and we are hopeful that widespread starvation will be\navoided.Good progress has been made since the Venice Economic Summit called for\nincreased effort on this front. We and other donor countries have begun to\nassist poor countries develop long-term strategies to improve their food\nproduction. The World Bank will invest up to $4 billion in the next few\nyears in improving the grain storage and food-handling capacity of\ncountries prone to food shortages.Good progress has been made since the Tokyo Economic Summit called for\nincreased effort on this front. The World Bank is giving this problem top\npriority, as are some other donor countries. The resources of the\nconsultative Group on International Agricultural Research will be doubled\nover a five-year period. The work of our own Institute of Scientific and\nTechnological Cooperation will further strengthen the search for relevant\nnew agricultural technologies.The goal of freeing the world from hunger by the year 2000 should command\nthe full support of all countries.The Human Dimension of Foreign PolicyHUMAN RIGHTSThe human rights policy of the United States has been an integral part of\nour overall foreign policy for the past several years. This policy serves\nthe national interest of the United States in several important ways: by\nencouraging respect by governments for the basic rights of human beings, it\npromotes peaceful, constructive change, reduces the likelihood of internal\npressures for violent change and for the exploitation of these by our\nadversaries, and thus directly serves our long-term interest in peace and\nstability; by matching espousal of fundamental American principles of\nfreedom with specific foreign policy actions, we stand out in vivid\ncontrast to our ideological adversaries; by our efforts to expand freedom\nelsewhere, we render our own freedom, and our own nation, more secure.\nCountries that respect human rights make stronger allies and better\nfriends.Rather than attempt to dictate what system of government or institutions\nother countries should have, the U.S. supports, throughout the world, the\ninternationally recognized human rights which all members of the United\nNations have pledged themselves to respect. There is more than one model\nthat can satisfy the continuing human reach for freedom and justice:1980 has been a year of some disappointments, but has also seen some\npositive developments in the ongoing struggle for fulfillment of human\nrights throughout the world. In the year we have seen:--Free elections were held and democratic governments installed in Peru,\nDominica, and Jamaica. Honduras held a free election for installation of a\nconstituent assembly. An interim government was subsequently named pointing\ntoward national presidential elections in 1981. Brazil continues on its\ncourse of political liberalization.--The \"Charter of Conduct\" signed in Riobamba, Ecuador, by Ecuador,\nColombia, Venezuela, Peru, Costa Rica, Panama and Spain, affirms the\nimportance of democracy and human rights for the Andean countries.--The Organization of American States, in its annual General Assembly,\napproved a resolution in support of the Inter-American Human Rights\nCommission's work. The resolution took note of the Commission's annual\nreport, which described the status of human rights in Chile, El Salvador,\nParaguay and Uruguay; and the special reports on Argentina and Haiti, which\ndescribed human rights conditions as investigated during on-site\ninspections to these countries.--The awarding of the Nobel Prize for Peace to Adolfo Perez Esquivel of\nArgentina for his non-violent advocacy of human rights.--The United States was able to rejoin the International Labor\nOrganization after an absence of two years, as that U.N. body reformed its\nprocedures to return to its original purpose of strengthening\nemployer-employee-government relations to insure human rights for the\nworking people of the world.The United States, of course, cannot take credit for all these various\ndevelopments. But we can take satisfaction in knowing that our policies\nencourage and perhaps influence them.Those who see a contradiction between our security and our humanitarian\ninterests forget that the basis for a secure and stable society is the bond\nof trust between a government and its people. I profoundly believe that the\nfuture of our world is not to be found in authoritarianism: that wears the\nmask of order, or totalitarianism that wears the mask of justice. Instead,\nlet us find our future in the human face of democracy, the human voice of\nindividual liberty, the human hand of economic development.HUMANITARIAN AIDThe United States has continued to play its traditional role of safehaven\nfor those who flee or are forced to flee their homes because of persecution\nor war. During 1980, the United States provided resettlement opportunities\nfor 216,000 refugees from countries around the globe. In addition, the\nUnited States joined with other nations to provide relief to refugees in\ncountry of first asylum in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.The great majority of refugee admissions continued to be from Indo-china.\nDuring 1980, 168,000 Indo-chinese were resettled in the United States.\nAlthough refugee populations persist in camps in Southeast Asia, and\nrefugees continue to flee Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea, the flow is not as\ngreat as in the past. One factor in reducing the flow from Vietnam has been\nthe successful negotiation and commencement of an Orderly Departure Program\nwhich permits us to process Vietnamese for resettlement in the United\nStates with direct departure from Ho Chi Minh Ville in an orderly fashion.\nThe first group of 250 departed Vietnam for the United States in December,\n1980.In addition to the refugees admitted last year, the United States accepted\nfor entry into the United States 125,000 Cubans who were expelled by Fidel\nCastro. Federal and state authorities, as well as private voluntary\nagencies, responded with unprecedented vigor to coping with the unexpected\ninflux of Cubans.Major relief efforts to aid refugees in countries of first asylum continued\nin several areas of the world. In December, 1980, thirty-two nations,\nmeeting in New York City, agreed to contribute $65 million to the\ncontinuing famine relief program in Kampuchea. Due in great part to the\ngenerosity of the American people and the leadership exercised in the\ninternational arena by the United States, we have played the pivotal role\nin ameliorating massive suffering in Kampuchea.The United States has taken the lead among a group of donor countries who\nare providing relief to some two million refugees in the Horn of Africa who\nhave been displaced by fighting in Ethiopia. U.S. assistance, primarily to\nSomalia, consists of $35 million worth of food and $18 million in cash and\nkind. Here again, United States efforts can in large part be credited with\nkeeping hundreds of thousands of people alive.Another major international relief effort has been mounted in Pakistan. The\nUnited States is one of 25 countries plus the European Economic Community\nwho have been helping the Government of Pakistan to cope with the problem\nof feeding and sheltering the more than one million refugees that have been\ngenerated by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.In April, 1980, the Congress passed the Refugee Act of 1980 which brought\ntogether, for the first time, in one piece of legislation the various\nthreads of U.S. policy towards refugees. The law laid down a new, broader\ndefinition of the term refugee, established mechanisms for arriving at a\nlevel of refugee admissions through consultation with Congress, and\nestablished the Office of the United States Coordinator for Refugees.It cannot be ignored that the destructive and aggressive policies of the\nSoviet Union have added immeasurably to the suffering in these three tragic\nsituations.The Control of Nuclear WeaponsTogether with our friends and allies, we are striving to build a world in\nwhich peoples with diverse interests can live freely and prosper. But all\nthat humankind has achieved to date, all that we are seeking to accomplish,\nand human existence itself can be undone in an instant--in the catastrophe\nof a nuclear war.Thus one of the central objectives of my Administration has been to control\nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons to those nations which do not have\nthem, and their further development by the existing nuclear powers--\nnotably the Soviet Union and the United States.NON-PROLIFERATIONMy Administration has been committed to stemming the spread of nuclear\nweapons. Nuclear proliferation would raise the spectre of the use of\nnuclear explosives in crucial, unstable regions of the world endangering\nnot only our security and that of our Allies, but that of the whole world.\nNon-proliferation is not and can not be a unilateral U.S. policy, nor\nshould it be an issue of contention between the industrialized and\ndeveloping states. The international non-proliferation effort requires the\nsupport of suppliers as well as importers of nuclear technology and\nmaterials.We have been proceeding on a number of fronts:--First, we have been seeking to encourage nations to accede to the\nNon-Proliferation Treaty. The U.S. is also actively encouraging other\nnations to accept full-scope safeguards on all of their nuclear activities\nand is asking other nuclear suppliers to adopt a full-scope safeguards\nrequirement as a condition for future supply.--Second, the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation (INFCE), which\nwas completed in 1980, demonstrated that suppliers and recipients can work\ntogether on these technically complex and sensitive issues. While\ndifferences remain, the INFCE effort provides a broader international basis\nfor national decisions which must balance energy needs with\nnon-proliferation concerns.--Finally, we are working to encourage regional cooperation and restraint.\nProtocol I of the Treaty of Tlatelolco which will contribute to the\nlessening of nuclear dangers for our Latin American neighbors ought now to\nbe ratified by the United States Senate.LIMITATIONS ON STRATEGIC ARMSI remain convinced that the SALT II Treaty is in our Nation's security\ninterest and that it would add significantly to the control of nuclear\nweapons. I strongly support continuation of the SALT process and the\nnegotiation of more far-reaching mutual restraints on nuclear weaponry.CONCLUSIONWe have new support in the world for our purposes of national independence\nand individual human dignity. We have a new will at home to do what is\nrequired to keep us the strongest nation on earth.We must move together into this decade with the strength which comes from\nrealization of the dangers before us and from the confidence that together\nwe can overcome them.
