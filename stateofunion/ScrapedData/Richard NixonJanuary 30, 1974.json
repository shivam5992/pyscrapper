    "speech": "Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Congress, our\ndistinguished guests, my fellow Americans:We meet here tonight at a time of great challenge and great opportunities\nfor America. We meet at a time when we face great problems at home and\nabroad that will test the strength of our fiber as a nation. But we also\nmeet at a time when that fiber has been tested, and it has proved strong.America is a great and good land, and we are a great and good land because\nwe are a strong, free, creative people and because America is the single\ngreatest force for peace anywhere in the world. Today, as always in our\nhistory, we can base our confidence in what the American people will\nachieve in the future on the record of what the American people have\nachieved in the past.Tonight, for the first time in 12 years, a President of the United States\ncan report to the Congress on the state of a Union at peace with every\nnation of the world. Because of this, in the 22,000-word message on the\nstate of the Union that I have just handed to the Speaker of the House and\nthe President of the Senate, I have been able to deal primarily with the\nproblems of peace with what we can do here at home in America for the\nAmerican people--rather than with the problems of war.The measures I have outlined in this message set an agenda for truly\nsignificant progress for this Nation and the world in 1974. Before we chart\nwhere we are going, let us see how far we have come.It was 5 years ago on the steps of this Capitol that I took the oath of\noffice as your President. In those 5 years, because of the initiatives\nundertaken by this Administration, the world has changed. America has\nchanged. As a result of those changes, America is safer today, more\nprosperous today, with greater opportunity for more of its people than ever\nbefore in our history.Five years ago, America was at war in Southeast Asia. We were locked in\nconfrontation with the Soviet Union. We were in hostile isolation from a\nquarter of the world's people who lived in Mainland China.Five years ago, our cities were burning and besieged.Five years ago, our college campuses were a battleground.Five years ago, crime was increasing at a rate that struck fear across the\nNation.Five years ago, the spiraling rise in drug addiction was threatening human\nand social tragedy of massive proportion, and there was no program to deal\nwith it.Five years ago--as young Americans had done for a generation before\nthat--America's youth still lived under the shadow of the military draft.Five years ago, there was no national program to preserve our environment.\nDay by day, our air was getting dirtier, our water was getting more foul.And 5 years ago, American agriculture was practically a depressed industry\nwith 100,000 farm families abandoning the farm every year.As we look at America today, we find ourselves challenged by new problems.\nBut we also find a record of progress to confound the professional criers\nof doom and prophets of despair. We met the challenges we faced 5 years\nago, and we will be equally confident of meeting those that we face today.Let us see for a moment how we have met them.After more than 10 years of military involvement, all of our troops have\nreturned from Southeast Asia, and they have returned with honor. And we can\nbe proud of the fact that our courageous prisoners of war, for whom a\ndinner was held in Washington tonight, that they came home with their heads\nhigh, on their feet and not on their knees.In our relations with the Soviet Union, we have turned away from a policy\nof confrontation to one of negotiation. For the first time since World War\nII, the world's two strongest powers are working together toward peace in\nthe world. With the People's Republic of China after a generation of\nhostile isolation, we have begun a period of peaceful exchange and\nexpanding trade.Peace has returned to our cities, to our campuses. The 17-year rise in\ncrime has been stopped. We can confidently say today that we are finally\nbeginning to win the war against crime. Right here in this Nation's\nCapital--which a few years ago was threatening to become the crime capital\nof the world--the rate in crime has been cut in half. A massive campaign\nagainst drug abuse has been organized. And the rate of new heroin\naddiction, the most vicious threat of all, is decreasing rather than\nincreasing.For the first time in a generation, no young Americans are being drafted\ninto the armed services of the United States. And for the first time ever,\nwe have organized a massive national effort to protect the environment. Our\nair is getting cleaner, our water is getting purer, and our agriculture,\nwhich was depressed, is prospering. Farm income is up 70 percent, farm\nproduction is setting all-time records, and the billions of dollars the\ntaxpayers were paying in subsidies has been cut to nearly zero.Overall, Americans are living more abundantly than ever before, today. More\nthan 2 1/2 million new jobs were created in the past year alone. That is\nthe biggest percentage increase in nearly 20 years. People are earning\nmore. What they earn buys more, more than ever before in history. In the\npast 5 years, the average American's real spendable income--that is, what\nyou really can buy with your income, even after allowing for taxes and\ninflation--has increased by 16 percent.Despite this record of achievement, as we turn to the year ahead we hear\nonce again the familiar voice of the perennial prophets of gloom telling us\nnow that because of the need to fight inflation, because of the energy\nshortage, America may be headed for a recession.Let me speak to that issue head on. There will be no recession in the\nUnited States of America. Primarily due to our energy crisis, our economy\nis passing through a difficult period. But I pledge to you tonight that the\nfull powers of this Government will be used to keep America's economy\nproducing and to protect the jobs of America's workers.We are engaged in a long and hard fight against inflation. There have been,\nand there will be in the future, ups and downs in that fight. But if this\nCongress cooperates in our efforts to hold down the cost of Government, we\nshall win our fight to hold down the cost of living for the American\npeople.As we look back over our history, the years that stand out as the ones of\nsignal achievement are those in which the Administration and the Congress,\nwhether one party or the other, working together, had the wisdom and the\nforesight to select those particular initiatives for which the Nation was\nready and the moment was right--and in which they seized the moment and\nacted.Looking at the year 1974 which lies before us, there are 10 key areas in\nwhich landmark accomplishments are possible this year in America. If we\nmake these our national agenda, this is what we will achieve in 1974:We will break the back of the energy crisis; we will lay the foundation for\nour future capacity to meet America's energy needs from America's own\nresources.And we will take another giant stride toward lasting peace in the\nworld--not only by continuing our policy of negotiation rather than\nconfrontation where the great powers are concerned but also by helping\ntoward the achievement of a just and lasting settlement in the Middle\nEast.We will check the rise in prices without administering the harsh medicine\nof recession, and we will move the economy into a steady period of growth\nat a sustainable level.We will establish a new system that makes high-quality health care\navailable to every American in a dignified manner and at a price he can\nafford.We will make our States and localities more responsive to the needs of\ntheir own citizens.We will make a crucial breakthrough toward better transportation in our\ntowns and in our cities across America.We will reform our system of Federal aid to education, to provide it when\nit is needed, where it is needed, so that it will do the most for those who\nneed it the most.We will make an historic beginning on the task of defining and protecting\nthe right of personal privacy for every American.And we will start on a new road toward reform of a welfare system that\nbleeds the taxpayer, corrodes the community, and demeans those it is\nintended to assist.And together with the other nations of the world, we will establish the\neconomic framework within which Americans will share more fully in an\nexpanding worldwide trade and prosperity in the years ahead, with more open\naccess to both markets and supplies.In all of the 186 State of the Union messages delivered from this place, in\nour history this is the first in which the one priority, the first\npriority, is energy. Let me begin by reporting a new development which I\nknow will be welcome news to every American. As you know, we have committed\nourselves to an active role in helping to achieve a just and durable peace\nin the Middle East, on the basis of full implementation of Security Council\nResolutions 242 and 338. The first step in the process is the disengagement\nof Egyptian and Israeli forces which is now taking place.Because of this hopeful development, I can announce tonight that I have\nbeen assured, through my personal contacts with friendly leaders in the\nMiddle Eastern area, that an urgent meeting will be called in the immediate\nfuture to discuss the lifting of the oil embargo.This is an encouraging sign. However, it should be clearly understood by\nour friends in the Middle East that the United States will not be coerced\non this issue.Regardless of the outcome of this meeting, the cooperation of the American\npeople in our energy conservation program has already gone a long way\ntowards achieving a goal to which I am deeply dedicated. Let us do\neverything we can to avoid gasoline rationing in the United States of\nAmerica.Last week, I sent to the Congress a comprehensive special message setting\nforth our energy situation, recommending the legislative measures which are\nnecessary to a program for meeting our needs. If the embargo is lifted,\nthis will ease the crisis, but it will not mean an end to the energy\nshortage in America. Voluntary conservation will continue to be necessary.\nAnd let me take this occasion to pay tribute once again to the splendid\nspirit of cooperation the American people have shown which has made\npossible our success in meeting this emergency up to this time.The new legislation I have requested will also remain necessary. Therefore,\nI urge again that the energy measures that I have proposed be made the\nfirst priority of this session of the Congress. These measures will require\nthe oil companies and other energy producers to provide the public with the\nnecessary information on their supplies. They will prevent the injustice of\nwindfall profits for a few as a result of the sacrifices of the millions of\nAmericans. And they will give us the organization, the incentives, the\nauthorities needed to deal with the short-term emergency and to move toward\nmeeting our long-term needs.Just as 1970 was the year in which we began a full-scale effort to protect\nthe environment, 1974 must be the year in which we organize a full-scale\neffort to provide for our energy needs, not only in this decade but through\nthe 21st century.As we move toward the celebration 2 years from now of the 200th anniversary\nof this Nation's independence, let us press vigorously on toward the goal I\nannounced last November for Project Independence. Let this be our national\ngoal: At the end of this decade, in the year 1980, the United States will\nnot be dependent on any other country for the energy we need to provide our\njobs, to heat our homes, and to keep our transportation moving.To indicate the size of the Government commitment, to spur energy research\nand development, we plan to spend $10 billion in Federal funds over the\nnext 5 years. That is an enormous amount. But during the same 5 years,\nprivate enterprise will be investing as much as $200 billion--and in 10\nyears, $500 billion--to develop the new resources, the new technology, the\nnew capacity America will require for its energy needs in the 1980's. That\nis just a measure of the magnitude of the project we are undertaking.But America performs best when called to its biggest tasks. It can truly be\nsaid that only in America could a task so tremendous be achieved so\nquickly, and achieved not by regimentation, but through the effort and\ningenuity of a free people, working in a free system.Turning now to the rest of the agenda for 1974, the time is at hand this\nyear to bring comprehensive, high quality health care within the reach of\nevery American. I shall propose a sweeping new program that will assure\ncomprehensive health insurance protection to millions of Americans who\ncannot now obtain it or afford it, with vastly improved protection against\ncatastrophic illnesses. This will be a plan that maintains the high\nstandards of quality in America's health care. And it will not require\nadditional taxes.Now, I recognize that other plans have been put forward that would cost $80\nbillion or even $100 billion and that would put our whole health care\nsystem under the heavy hand of the Federal Government. This is the wrong\napproach. This has been tried abroad, and it has failed. It is not the way\nwe do things here in America. This kind of plan would threaten the quality\nof care provided by our whole health care system. The right way is one that\nbuilds on the strengths of the present system and one that does not destroy\nthose strengths, one based on partnership, not paternalism. Most important\nof all, let us keep this as the guiding principle of our health programs.\nGovernment has a great role to play, but we must always make sure that our\ndoctors will be working for their patients and not for the Federal\nGovernment.Many of you will recall that in my State of the Union Address 3 years ago,\nI commented that \"Most Americans today are simply fed up with government at\nall levels,\" and I recommended a sweeping set of proposals to revitalize\nState and local governments, to make them more responsive to the people\nthey serve. I can report to you today that as a result of revenue sharing\npassed by the Congress, and other measures, we have made progress toward\nthat goal. After 40 years of moving power from the States and the\ncommunities to Washington, D.C., we have begun moving power back from\nWashington to the States and communities and, most important, to the people\nof America.In this session of the Congress, I believe we are near the breakthrough\npoint on efforts which I have suggested, proposals to let people themselves\nmake their own decisions for their own communities and, in particular, on\nthose to provide broad new flexibility in Federal aid for community\ndevelopment, for economic development, for education. And I look forward to\nworking with the Congress, with members of both parties in resolving\nwhatever remaining differences we have in this legislation so that we can\nmake available nearly $5 1/2 billion to our States and localities to use\nnot for what a Federal bureaucrat may want, but for what their own people\nin those communities want. The decision should be theirs.I think all of us recognize that the energy crisis has given new urgency to\nthe need to improve public transportation, not only in our cities but in\nrural areas as well. The program I have proposed this year will give\ncommunities not only more money but also more freedom to balance their own\ntransportation needs. It will mark the strongest Federal commitment ever to\nthe improvement of mass transit as an essential element of the improvement\nof life in our towns and cities.One goal on which all Americans agree is that our children should have the\nvery best education this great Nation can provide.In a special message last week, I recommended a number of important new\nmeasures that can make 1974 a year of truly significant advances for our\nschools and for the children they serve. If the Congress will act on these\nproposals, more flexible funding will enable each Federal dollar to meet\nbetter the particular need of each particular school district. Advance\nfunding will give school authorities a chance to make each year's plans,\nknowing ahead of time what Federal funds they are going to receive. Special\ntargeting will give special help to the truly disadvantaged among our\npeople. College students faced with rising costs for their education will\nbe able to draw on an expanded program of loans and grants. These advances\nare a needed investment in America's most precious resource, our next\ngeneration. And I urge the Congress to act on this legislation in 1974.One measure of a truly free society is the vigor with which it protects the\nliberties of its individual citizens. As technology has advanced in\nAmerica, it has increasingly encroached on one of those liberties--what I\nterm the right of personal privacy. Modern information systems, data banks,\ncredit records, mailing list abuses, electronic snooping, the collection of\npersonal data for one purpose that may be used for another--all these have\nleft millions of Americans deeply concerned by the privacy they cherish.And the time has come, therefore, for a major initiative to define the\nnature and extent of the basic rights of privacy and to erect new\nsafeguards to ensure that those rights are respected.I shall launch such an effort this year at the highest levels of the\nAdministration, and I look forward again to working with this Congress in\nestablishing a new set of standards that respect the legitimate needs of\nsociety, but that also recognize personal privacy as a cardinal principle\nof American liberty.Many of those in this Chamber tonight will recall that it was 3 years ago\nthat I termed the Nation's welfare system \"a monstrous, consuming\noutrage--an outrage against the community, against the taxpayer, and\nparticularly against the children that it is supposed to help.\"That system is still an outrage. By improving its administration, we have\nbeen able to reduce some of the abuses. As a result, last year, for the\nfirst time in 18 years, there has been a halt in the growth of the welfare\ncaseload. But as a system, our welfare program still needs reform as\nurgently today as it did when I first proposed in 1969 that we completely\nreplace it with a different system.In these final 3 years of my Administration, I urge the Congress to join me\nin mounting a major new effort to replace the discredited present welfare\nsystem with one that works, one that is fair to those who need help or\ncannot help themselves, fair to the community, and fair to the taxpayer.\nAnd let us have as our goal that there will be no Government program which\nmakes it more profitable to go on welfare than to go to work.I recognize that from the debates that have taken place within the Congress\nover the past 3 years on this program that we cannot expect enactment\novernight of a new reform. But I do propose that the Congress and the\nAdministration together make this the year in which we discuss, debate, and\nshape such a reform so that it can be enacted as quickly as possible.America's own prosperity in the years ahead depends on our sharing fully\nand equitably in an expanding world prosperity. Historic negotiations will\ntake place this year that will enable us to ensure fair treatment in\ninternational markets for American workers, American farmers, American\ninvestors, and American consumers.It is vital that the authorities contained in the trade bill I submitted to\nthe Congress be enacted so that the United States can negotiate flexibly\nand vigorously on behalf of American interests. These negotiations can\nusher in a new era of international trade that not only increases the\nprosperity of all nations but also strengthens the peace among all\nnations.In the past 5 years, we have made more progress toward a lasting structure\nof peace in the world than in any comparable time in the Nation's history.\nWe could not have made that progress if we had not maintained the military\nstrength of America. Thomas Jefferson once observed that the price of\nliberty is eternal vigilance. By the same token, and for the same reason,\nin today's world the price of peace is a strong defense as far as the\nUnited States is concerned.In the past 5 years, we have steadily reduced the burden of national\ndefense as a share of the budget, bringing it down from 44 percent in 1969\nto 29 percent in the current year. We have cut our military manpower over\nthe past 5 years by more than a third, from 3.5 million to 2.2 million.In the coming year, however, increased expenditures will be needed. They\nwill be needed to assure the continued readiness of our military forces, to\npreserve present force levels in the face of rising costs, and to give us\nthe military strength we must have if our security is to be maintained and\nif our initiatives for peace are to succeed.The question is not whether we can afford to maintain the necessary\nstrength of our defense, the question is whether we can afford not to\nmaintain it, and the answer to that question is no. We must never allow\nAmerica to become the second strongest nation in the world.I do not say this with any sense of belligerence, because I recognize the\nfact that is recognized around the world. America's military strength has\nalways been maintained to keep the peace, never to break it. It has always\nbeen used to defend freedom, never to destroy it. The world's peace, as\nwell as our own, depends on our remaining as strong as we need to be as\nlong as we need to be.In this year 1974, we will be negotiating with the Soviet Union to place\nfurther limits on strategic nuclear arms. Together with our allies, we will\nbe negotiating with the nations of the Warsaw Pact on mutual and balanced\nreduction of forces in Europe. And we will continue our efforts to promote\npeaceful economic development in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia. We will\npress for full compliance with the peace accords that brought an end to\nAmerican fighting in Indochina, including particularly a provision that\npromised the fullest possible accounting for those Americans who are\nmissing in action.And having in mind the energy crisis to which I have referred to earlier,\nwe will be working with the other nations of the world toward agreement on\nmeans by which oil supplies can be assured at reasonable prices on a stable\nbasis in a fair way to the consuming and producing nations alike.All of these are steps toward a future in which the world's peace and\nprosperity, and ours as well as a result, are made more secure.Throughout the 5 years that I have served as your President, I have had one\noverriding aim, and that was to establish a new structure of peace in the\nworld that can free future generations of the scourge of war. I can\nunderstand that others may have different priorities. This has been and\nthis will remain my first priority and the chief legacy I hope to leave\nfrom the 8 years of my Presidency.This does not mean that we shall not have other priorities, because as we\nstrengthen the peace, we must also continue each year a steady\nstrengthening of our society here at home. Our conscience requires it, our\ninterests require it, and we must insist upon it.As we create more jobs, as we build a better health care system, as we\nimprove our education, as we develop new sources of energy, as we provide\nmore abundantly for the elderly and the poor, as we strengthen the system\nof private enterprise that produces our prosperity--as we do all of this\nand even more, we solidify those essential bonds that hold us together as\na nation.Even more importantly, we advance what in the final analysis government in\nAmerica is all about.What it is all about is more freedom, more security, a better life for each\none of the 211 million people that live in this land.We cannot afford to neglect progress at home while pursuing peace abroad.\nBut neither can we afford to neglect peace abroad while pursuing progress\nat home. With a stable peace, all is possible, but without peace, nothing\nis possible.In the written message that I have just delivered to the Speaker and to the\nPresident of the Senate, I commented that one of the continuing challenges\nfacing us in the legislative process is that of the timing and pacing of\nour initiatives, selecting each year among many worthy projects those that\nare ripe for action at that time.What is true in terms of our domestic initiatives is true also in the\nworld. This period we now are in, in the world--and I say this as one who\nhas seen so much of the world, not only in these past 5 years but going\nback over many years--we are in a period which presents a juncture of\nhistoric forces unique in this century. They provide an opportunity we may\nnever have again to create a structure of peace solid enough to last a\nlifetime and more, not just peace in our time but peace in our children's\ntime as well. It is on the way we respond to this opportunity, more than\nanything else, that history will judge whether we in America have met our\nresponsibility. And I am confident we will meet that great historic\nresponsibility which is ours today.It was 27 years ago that John F. Kennedy and I sat in this Chamber, as\nfreshmen Congressmen, hearing our first State of the Union address\ndelivered by Harry Truman. I know from my talks with him, as members of the\nLabor Committee on which we both served, that neither of us then even\ndreamed that either one or both might eventually be standing in this place\nthat I now stand in now and that he once stood in, before me. It may well\nbe that one of the freshmen Members of the 93d Congress, one of you out\nthere, will deliver his own State of the Union message 27 years from now,\nin the year 2001.Well, whichever one it is, I want you to be able to look back with pride\nand to say that your first years here were great years and recall that you\nwere here in this 93d Congress when America ended its longest war and began\nits longest peace.Mr. Speaker, and Mr. President, and my distinguished colleagues and our\nguests: I would like to add a personal word with regard to an issue that\nhas been of great concern to all Americans over the past year. I refer, of\ncourse, to the investigations of the so-called Watergate affair. As you\nknow, I have provided to the Special Prosecutor voluntarily a great deal of\nmaterial. I believe that I have provided all the material that he needs to\nconclude his investigations and to proceed to prosecute the guilty and to\nclear the innocent.I believe the time has come to bring that investigation and the other\ninvestigations of this matter to an end. One year of Watergate is enough.And the time has come, my colleagues, for not only the Executive, the\nPresident, but the Members of Congress, for all of us to join together in\ndevoting our full energies to these great issues that I have discussed\ntonight which involve the welfare of all of the American people in so many\ndifferent ways, as well as the peace of the world.I recognize that the House Judiciary Committee has a special responsibility\nin this area, and I want to indicate on this occasion that I will cooperate\nwith the Judiciary Committee in its investigation. I will cooperate so that\nit can conclude its investigation, make its decision, and I will cooperate\nin any way that I consider consistent with my responsibilities to the\nOffice of the Presidency of the United States.There is only one limitation. I will follow the precedent that has been\nfollowed by and defended by every President from George Washington to\nLyndon B. Johnson of never doing anything that weakens the Office of the\nPresident of the United States or impairs the ability of the Presidents of\nthe future to make the great decisions that are so essential to this Nation\nand the world.Another point I should like to make very briefly: Like every Member of the\nHouse and Senate assembled here tonight, I was elected to the office that I\nhold. And like every Member of the House and Senate, when I was elected to\nthat office, I knew that I was elected for the purpose of doing a job and\ndoing it as well as I possibly can. And I want you to know that I have no\nintention whatever of ever walking away from the job that the people\nelected me to do for the people of the United States.Now, needless to say, it would be understatement if I were not to admit\nthat the year 1973 was not a very easy year for me personally or for my\nfamily. And as I have already indicated, the year 1974 presents very great\nand serious problems, as very great and serious opportunities are also\npresented.But my colleagues, this I believe: With the help of God, who has blessed\nthis land so richly, with the cooperation of the Congress, and with the\nsupport of the American people, we can and we will make the year 1974 a\nyear of unprecedented progress toward our goal of building a structure of\nlasting peace in the world and a new prosperity without war in the United\nStates of America.",
