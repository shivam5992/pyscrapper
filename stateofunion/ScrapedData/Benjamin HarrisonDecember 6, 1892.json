    "speech": "To the Senate and House of Representatives:In submitting my annual message to Congress I have great satisfaction in\nbeing able to say that the general conditions affecting the commercial and\nindustrial interests of the United States are in the highest degree\nfavorable. A comparison of the existing conditions with those of the most\nfavored period in the history of the country will, I believe, show that so\nhigh a degree of prosperity and so general a diffusion of the comforts of\nlife were never before enjoyed by our people.The total wealth of the country in 1860 was $16,159,616,068. In 1890 it\namounted to $62,610,000,000, an increase of 287 per cent.The total mileage of railways in the United States in 1860 was 30,626. In\n1890 it was 167,741, an increase of 448 per cent; and it is estimated that\nthere will be about 4,000 miles of track added by the close of the year\n1892.The official returns of the Eleventh Census and those of the Tenth Census\nfor seventy-five leading cities furnish the basis for the following\ncomparisons:In 1880 the capital invested in manufacturing was $1,232,839,670.In 1890 the capital invested in manufacturing was $2,900,735,884.In 1880 the number of employees was 1,301,388.In 1890 the number of employees was 2,251,134.In 1880 the wages earned were $501,965,778.In 1890 the wages earned were $1,221,170,454.In 1880 the value of the product was $2,711,579,899.In 1890 the value of the product was $4,860,286,837.I am informed by the Superintendent of the Census that the omission of\ncertain industries in 1880 which were included in 1890 accounts in part for\nthe remarkable increase thus shown, but after making full allowance for\ndifferences of method and deducting the returns for all industries not\nincluded in the census of 1880 there remain in the reports from these\nseventy-five cities an increase in the capital employed of $1,522,745,604,\nin the value of the product of $2,024,236,166, in wages earned of\n$677,943,929, and in the number of wage earners employed of 856,029. The\nwage earnings not only show an increased aggregate, but an increase per\ncapita from $386 in 1880 to $547 in 1890, or 41.71 per cent.The new industrial plants established since October 6, 1890, and up to\nOctober 22, 1892, as partially reported in the American Economist, number\n345, and the extension of existing plants 108; the new capital invested\namounts to $40,449,050, and the number of additional employees to 37,285.The Textile World for July, 1892, states that during the first six months\nof the present calendar year 135 new factories were built, of which 40 are\ncotton mills, 48 knitting mills, 26 woolen mills, 15 silk mills, 4 plush\nmills, and 2 linen mills. Of the 40 cotton mills 21 have been built in the\nSouthern States. Mr. A. B. Shepperson, of the New York Cotton Exchange,\nestimates the number of working spindles in the United States on September\n1, 1892, at 15,200,000, an increase of 660,000 over the year 1891. The\nconsumption of cotton by American mills in 1891 was 2,396,000 bales, and in\n1892 2,584,000 bales, an increase of 188,000 bales. From the year 1869 to\n1892, inclusive, there has been an increase in the consumption of cotton in\nEurope of 92 per cent, while during the same period the increased\nconsumption in the United States has been about 150 per cent.The report of Ira Ayer, special agent of the Treasury Department, shows\nthat at the date of September 30, 1892, there were 32 companies\nmanufacturing tin and terne plate in the United States and 14 companies\nbuilding new works for such manufacture. The estimated investment in\nbuildings and plants at the close of the fiscal year June 30, 1893, if\nexisting conditions were to be continued, was $5,000,000 and the estimated\nrate of production 200,000,000 pounds per annum. The actual production for\nthe quarter ending September 30, 1892, was 10,952,725 pounds.The report of Labor Commissioner Peck, of New York, shows that during the\nyear 1891, in about 6,000 manufacturing establishments in that State\nembraced within the special inquiry made by him, and representing 67\ndifferent industries, there was a net increase over the year 1890 of\n$30,315,130.68 in the value of the product and of $6,377,925.09 in the\namount of wages paid. The report of the commissioner of labor for the State\nof Massachusetts shows that 3,745 industries in that State paid\n$129,416,248 in wages during the year 1891, against $126,030,303 in 1890,\nan increase of $3,335,945, and that there was an increase of $9,932,490 in\nthe amount of capital and of 7,346 in the number of persons employed in the\nsame period.During the last six months of the year 1891 and the first six months of\n1892 the total production of pig iron was 9,710,819 tons, as against\n9,202,703 tons in the year 1890, which was the largest annual production\never attained. For the same twelve months of 1891-92 the production of\nBessemer ingots was 3,878,581 tons, an increase of 189,710 gross tons over\nthe previously unprecedented yearly production of 3,688,871 gross tons in\n1890. The production of Bessemer steel rails for the first six months of\n1892 was 772,436 gross tons, as against 702,080 gross tons during the last\nsix months of the year 1891.The total value of our foreign trade (exports and imports of merchandise)\nduring the last fiscal year was $1,857,680,610, an increase of $128,283,604\nover the previous fiscal year. The average annual value of our imports and\nexports of merchandise for the ten fiscal years prior to 1891 was\n$1,457,322,019. It will be observed that our foreign trade for 1892\nexceeded this annual average value by $400,358,591, an increase of 27.47\nper cent. The significance and value of this increase are shown by the fact\nthat the excess in the trade of 1892 over 1891 was wholly in the value of\nexports, for there was a decrease in the value of imports of $17,513,754.The value of our exports during the fiscal year 1892 reached the highest\nfigure in the history of the Government, amounting to $1,030,278,148,\nexceeding by $145,797,338 the exports of 1891 and exceeding the value of\nthe imports by $202,875,686. A comparison of the value of our exports for\n1892 with the annual average for the ten years prior to 1891 shows an\nexcess of $265,142,651, or of 34.65 per cent. The value of our imports of\nmerchandise for 1892, which was $829,402,462, also exceeded the annual\naverage value of the ten years prior to 1891 by $135,215,940. During the\nfiscal year 1892 the value of imports free of duty amounted to\n$457,999,658, the largest aggregate in the history of our commerce. The\nvalue of the imports of merchandise entered free of duty in 1892 was 55.35\nper cent of the total value of imports, as compared with 43.35 per cent in\n1891 and 33.66 per cent in 1890.In our coastwise trade a most encouraging development is in progress, there\nhaving been in the last four years an increase of 16 per cent. In internal\ncommerce the statistics show that no such period of prosperity has ever\nbefore existed. The freight carried in the coastwise trade of the Great\nLakes in 1890 aggregated 28,295,959 tons. On the Mississippi, Missouri, and\nOhio rivers and tributaries in the same year the traffic aggregated\n29,405,046 tons, and the total vessel tonnage passing through the Detroit\nRiver during that year was 21,684,000 tons. The vessel tonnage entered and\ncleared in the foreign trade of London during 1890 amounted to 13,480,767\ntons, and of Liverpool 10,941,800 tons, a total for these two great\nshipping ports of 24,422,568 tons, only slightly in excess of the vessel\ntonnage passing through the Detroit River. And it should be said that the\nseason for the Detroit River was but 228 days, while of course in London\nand Liverpool the season was for the entire year. The vessel tonnage\npassing through the St. Marys Canal for the fiscal year 1892 amounted to\n9,828,874 tons, and the freight tonnage of the Detroit River is estimated\nfor that year at 25,000,000 tons, against 23,209,619 tons in 1891. The\naggregate traffic on our railroads for the year 1891 amounted to\n704,398,609 tons of freight, compared with 691,344,437 tons in 1890, an\nincrease of 13,054,172 tons.Another indication of the general prosperity of the country is found in the\nfact that the number of depositors in savings banks increased from 693,870\nin 1860 to 4,258,893 in 1890, an increase of 513 per cent, and the amount\nof deposits from $149,277,504 in 1860 to $1,524,844,506 in 1890, an\nincrease of 921 per cent. In 1891 the amount of deposits in savings banks\nwas $1,623,079,749. It is estimated that 90 per cent of these deposits\nrepresent the savings of wage earners. The bank clearances for nine months\nending September 30, 1891, amounted to $41,049,390,08. For the same months\nin 1892 they amounted to $45,189,601,947, an excess for the nine months of\n$4,140,211,139.There never has been a time in our history when work was so abundant or\nwhen wages were as high, whether measured by the currency in which they are\npaid or by their power to supply the necessaries and comforts of life. It\nis true that the market prices of cotton and wheat have been low. It is one\nof the unfavorable incidents of agriculture that the farmer can not produce\nupon orders. He must sow and reap in ignorance of the aggregate production\nof the year, and is peculiarly subject to the depreciation which follows\noverproduction. But while the fact I have stated is true as to the crops\nmentioned, the general average of prices has been such as to give to\nagriculture a fair participation in the general prosperity. The value of\nour total farm products has increased from $1,363,646,866 in 1860 to\n$4,500,000,000 in 1891, as estimated by statisticians, an increase of 230\nper cent. The number of hogs January 1, 1891, was 50,625,106 and their\nvalue $210,193,925; on January 1, 1892, the number was 52,398,019 and the\nvalue $241,031,415. On January 1, 1891, the number of cattle was 36,875,648\nand the value $544,127,908; on January 1 ,1892, the number was 37,651,239\nand the value $570,749,155.If any are discontented with their state here, if any believe that wages or\nprices, the returns for honest toil, are inadequate, they should not fail\nto remember that there is no other country in the world where the\nconditions that seem to them hard would not be accepted as highly\nprosperous. The English agriculturist would be glad to exchange the returns\nof his labor for those of the American farmer and the Manchester workmen\ntheir wages for those of their fellows at Fall River.I believe that the protective system, which has now for something more than\nthirty years continuously prevailed in our legislation, has been a mighty\ninstrument for the development of our national wealth and a most powerful\nagency in protecting the homes of our workingmen from the invasion of want.\nI have felt a most solicitous interest to preserve to our working people\nrates of wages that would not only give daily bread but supply a\ncomfortable margin for those home attractions and family comforts and\nenjoyments without which life is neither hopeful nor sweet. They are\nAmerican citizens--a part of the great people for whom our Constitution and\nGovernment were framed and instituted--and it can not be a perversion of\nthat Constitution to so legislate as to preserve in their homes the\ncomfort, independence, loyalty, and sense of interest in the Government\nwhich are essential to good citizenship in peace, and which will bring this\nstalwart throng, as in 1861, to the defense of the flag when it is\nassailed.It is not my purpose to renew here the argument in favor of a protective\ntariff. The result of the recent election must be accepted as having\nintroduced a new policy. We must assume that the present tariff,\nconstructed upon the lines of protection, is to be repealed and that there\nis to be substituted for it a tariff law constructed solely with reference\nto revenue; that no duty is to be higher because the increase will keep\nopen an American mill or keep up the wages of an American workman, but that\nin every case such a rate of duty is to be imposed as will bring to the\nTreasury of the United States the largest returns of revenue. The\ncontention has not been between schedules, but between principles, and it\nwould be offensive to suggest that the prevailing party will not carry into\nlegislation the principles advocated by it and the pledges given to the\npeople. The tariff bills passed by the House of Representatives at the last\nsession were, as I suppose, even in the opinion of their promoters,\ninadequate, and justified only by the fact that the Senate and House of\nRepresentatives were not in accord and that a general revision could not\ntherefore be undertaken.I recommend that the whole subject of tariff revision be left to the\nincoming Congress. It is matter of regret that this work must be delayed\nfor at least three months, for the threat of great tariff changes\nintroduces so much uncertainty that an amount, not easily estimated, of\nbusiness inaction and of diminished production will necessarily result. It\nis possible also that this uncertainty may result in decreased revenues\nfrom customs duties, for our merchants will make cautious orders for\nforeign goods in view of the prospect of tariff reductions and the\nuncertainty as to when they will take effect. Those who have advocated a\nprotective tariff can well afford to have their disastrous forecasts of a\nchange of policy disappointed. If a system of customs duties can be framed\nthat will set the idle wheels and looms of Europe in motion and crowd our\nwarehouses with foreign-made goods and at the same time keep our own mills\nbusy; that will give us an increased participation in the \"markets of the\nworld\" of greater value than the home market we surrender; that will give\nincreased work to foreign workmen upon products to be consumed by our\npeople without diminishing the amount of work to be done here; that will\nenable the American manufacturer to pay to his workmen from 50 to 100 per\ncent more in wages than is paid in the foreign mill, and yet to compete in\nour market and in foreign markets with the foreign producer; that will\nfurther reduce the cost of articles of wear and food without reducing the\nwages of those who produce them; that can be celebrated, after its effects\nhave been realized, as its expectation has been in European as well as in\nAmerican cities, the authors and promoters of it will be entitled to the\nhighest praise. We have had in our history several experiences of the\ncontrasted effects of a revenue and of a protective tariff, but this\ngeneration has not felt them, and the experience of one generation is not\nhighly instructive to the next. The friends of the protective system with\nundiminished confidence in the principles they have advocated will await\nthe results of the new experiment.The strained and too often disturbed relations existing between the\nemployees and the employers in our great manufacturing establishments have\nnot been favorable to a calm consideration by the wage earner of the effect\nupon wages of the protective system. The facts that his wages were the\nhighest paid in like callings in the world and that a maintenance of this\nrate of wages in the absence of protective duties upon the product of his\nlabor was impossible were obscured by the passion evoked by these contests.\nHe may now be able to review the question in the light of his personal\nexperience under the operation of a tariff for revenue only. If that\nexperience shall demonstrate that present rates of wages are thereby\nmaintained or increased, either absolutely or in their purchasing power,\nand that the aggregate volume of work to be done in this country is\nincreased or even maintained, so that there are more or as many days' work\nin a year, at as good or better wages, for the American workmen as has been\nthe case under the protective system, everyone will rejoice. A general\nprocess of wage reduction can not be contemplated by any patriotic citizen\nwithout the gravest apprehension. It may be, indeed I believe is, possible\nfor the American manufacturer to compete successfully with his foreign\nrival in many branches of production without the defense of protective\nduties if the pay rolls are equalized; but the conflict that stands between\nthe producer and that result and the distress of our working people when it\nis attained are not pleasant to contemplate. The Society of the Unemployed,\nnow holding its frequent and threatening parades in the streets of foreign\ncities, should not be allowed to acquire an American domicile.The reports of the heads of the several Executive Departments, which are\nherewith submitted, have very naturally included a resume of the whole work\nof the Administration with the transactions of the last fiscal year. The\nattention not only of Congress but of the country is again invited to the\nmethods of administration which have been pursued and to the results which\nhave been attained. Public revenues amounting to $1,414,079,292.28 have\nbeen collected and disbursed without loss from misappropriation, without a\nsingle defalcation of such importance as to attract the public attention,\nand at a diminished per cent of cost for collection. The public business\nhas been transacted not only with fidelity, but progressively and with a\nview to giving to the people in the fullest possible degree the benefits of\na service established and maintained for their protection and comfort.Our relations with other nations are now undisturbed by any serious\ncontroversy. The complicated and threatening differences with Germany and\nEngland relating to Samoan affairs, with England in relation to the seal\nfisheries in the Bering Sea, and with Chile growing out of the Baltimore\naffair have been adjusted.There have been negotiated and concluded, under section 3 of the tariff\nlaw, commercial agreements relating to reciprocal trade with the following\ncountries: Brazil, Dominican Republic, Spain for Cuba and Puerto Rico,\nGuatemala, Salvador, the German Empire, Great Britain for certain West\nIndian colonies and British Guiana, Nicaragua, Honduras, and\nAustria-Hungary.Of these, those with Guatemala, Salvador, the German Empire, Great Britain,\nNicaragua, Honduras, and Austria-Hungary have been concluded since my last\nannual message. Under these trade arrangements a free or favored admission\nhas been secured in every case for an important list of American products.\nEspecial care has been taken to secure markets for farm products, in order\nto relieve that great underlying industry of the depression which the lack\nof an adequate foreign market for our surplus often brings. An opening has\nalso been made for manufactured products that will undoubtedly, if this\npolicy is maintained, greatly augment our export trade. The full benefits\nof these arrangements can not be realized instantly. New lines of trade are\nto be opened. The commercial traveler must survey the field. The\nmanufacturer must adapt his goods to the new markets and facilities for\nexchange must be established. This work has been well begun, our merchants\nand manufacturers having entered the new fields with courage and\nenterprise. In the case of food products, and especially with Cuba, the\ntrade did not need to wait, and the immediate results have been most\ngratifying. If this policy and these trade arrangements can be continued in\nforce and aided by the establishment of American steamship lines, I do not\ndoubt that we shall within a short period secure fully one-third of the\ntotal trade of the countries of Central and South America, which now\namounts to about $600,000,000 annually. In 1885 we had only 8 per cent of\nthis trade.The following statistics show the increase in our trade with the countries\nwith which we have reciprocal trade agreements from the date when such\nagreements went into effect up to September 30, 1892, the increase being in\nsome almost wholly and in others in an important degree the result of these\nagreements:The domestic exports to Germany and Austria-Hungary have increased in value\nfrom $47,673,756 to $57,993,064, an increase of $10,319,308, or 21.63 per\ncent. With American countries the value of our exports has increased from\n$44,160,285 to $54,613,598, an increase of $10,453,313, or 23.67 per cent.\nThe total increase in the value of exports to all the countries with which\nwe have reciprocity agreements has been $20,772,621. This increase is\nchiefly in wheat, flour, meat, and dairy products and in manufactures of\niron and steel and lumber. There has been a large increase in the value of\nimports from all these countries since the commercial agreements went into\neffect, amounting to $74,294,525, but it has been entirely in imports from\nthe American countries, consisting mostly of sugar, coffee, india rubber,\nand crude drugs. The alarmed attention of our European competitors for the\nSouth American market has been attracted to this new American policy and to\nour acquisition and their loss of South American trade.A treaty providing for the arbitration of the dispute between Great Britain\nand the United States as to the killing of seals in the Bering Sea was\nconcluded on the 29th of February last. This treaty was accompanied by an\nagreement prohibiting pelagic sealing pending the arbitration, and a\nvigorous effort was made during this season to drive out all poaching\nsealers from the Bering Sea. Six naval vessels, three revenue cutters, and\none vessel from the Fish Commission, all under the command of Commander\nEvans, of the Navy, were sent into the sea, which was systematically\npatrolled. Some seizures were made, and it is believed that the catch in\nthe Bering Sea by poachers amounted to less than 500 seals. It is true,\nhowever, that in the North Pacific, while the seal herds were on their way\nto the passes between the Aleutian Islands, a very large number, probably\n35,000, were taken. The existing statutes of the United States do not\nrestrain our citizens from taking seals in the Pacific Ocean, and perhaps\nshould not unless the prohibition can be extended to the citizens of other\nnations. I recommend that power be given to the President by proclamation\nto prohibit the taking of seals in the North Pacific by American vessels in\ncase, either as the result of the findings of the Tribunal of Arbitration\nor otherwise, the restraints can be applied to the vessels of all\ncountries. The case of the United States for the Tribunal of Arbitration\nhas been prepared with great care and industry by the Hon. John W. Foster,\nand the counsel who represent this Government express confidence that a\nresult substantially establishing our claims and preserving this great\nindustry for the benefit of all nations will be attained.During the past year a suggestion was received through the British minister\nthat the Canadian government would like to confer as to the possibility of\nenlarging upon terms of mutual advantage the commercial exchanges of Canada\nand of the United States, and a conference was held at Washington, with Mr.\nBlaine acting for this Government and the British minister at this capital\nand three members of the Dominion cabinet acting as commissioners on the\npart of Great Britain. The conference developed the fact that the Canadian\ngovernment was only prepared to offer to the United States in exchange for\nthe concessions asked the admission of natural products. The statement was\nfrankly made that favored rates could not be given to the United States as\nagainst the mother country. This admission, which was foreseen, necessarily\nterminated the conference upon this question. The benefits of an exchange\nof natural products would be almost wholly with the people of Canada. Some\nother topics of interest were considered in the conference, and have\nresulted in the making of a convention for examining the Alaskan boundary\nand the waters of Passamaquoddy Bay adjacent to Eastport, Me., and in the\ninitiation of an arrangement for the protection of fish life in the\ncoterminous and neighboring waters of our northern border.The controversy as to tolls upon the Welland Canal, which was presented to\nCongress at the last session by special message, having failed of\nadjustment, I felt constrained to exercise the authority conferred by the\nact of July 26, 1892, and to proclaim a suspension of the free use of St.\nMarys Falls Canal to cargoes in transit to ports in Canada. The Secretary\nof the Treasury established such tolls as were thought to be equivalent to\nthe exactions unjustly levied upon our commerce in the Canadian canals.If, as we must suppose, the political relations of Canada and the\ndisposition of the Canadian government are to remain unchanged, a somewhat\nradical revision of our trade relations should, I think, be made. Our\nrelations must continue to be intimate, and they should be friendly. I\nregret to say, however, that in many of the controversies, notably those as\nto the fisheries on the Atlantic, the sealing interests on the Pacific, and\nthe canal tolls, our negotiations with Great Britain have continuously been\nthwarted or retarded by unreasonable and unfriendly objections and protests\nfrom Canada in the matter of the canal tolls our treaty rights were\nflagrantly disregarded. It is hardly too much to say that the Canadian\nPacific and other railway lines which parallel our northern boundary are\nsustained by commerce having either its origin or terminus, or both, in the\nUnited States. Canadian railroads compete with those of the United States\nfor our traffic, and without the restraints of our interstate-commerce act.\nTheir cars pass almost without detention into and out of our territory.The Canadian Pacific Railway brought into the United States from China and\nJapan via British Columbia during the year ended June 30, 1892, 23,239,689\npounds of freight, and it carried from the United States, to be shipped to\nChina and Japan via British Columbia, 24,068,346 pounds of freight. There\nwere also shipped from the United States over this road from Eastern ports\nof the United States to our Pacific ports during the same year 13,912,073\npounds of freight, and there were received over this road at the United\nStates Eastern ports from ports on the Pacific Coast 13,293,315 pounds of\nfreight. Mr. Joseph Nimmo, Jr., former chief of the Bureau of Statistics,\nwhen before the Senate Select Committee on Relations with Canada, April 26,\n1890, said that \"the value of goods thus transported between different\npoints in the United States across Canadian territory probably amounts to\n$100,000,000 a year.\"There is no disposition on the part of the people or Government of the\nUnited States to interfere in the smallest degree with the political\nrelations of Canada. That question is wholly with her own people. It is\ntime for us, however, to consider whether, if the present state of things\nand trend of things is to continue, our interchanges upon lines of land\ntransportation should not be put upon a different basis and our entire\nindependence of Canadian canals and of the St. Lawrence as an outlet to the\nsea secured by the construction of an American canal around the Falls of\nNiagara and the opening of ship communication between the Great Lakes and\none of our own seaports. We should not hesitate to avail ourselves of our\ngreat natural trade advantages. We should withdraw the support which is\ngiven to the railroads and steamship lines of Canada by a traffic that\nproperly belongs to us and no longer furnish the earnings which lighten the\notherwise crushing weight of the enormous public subsidies that have been\ngiven to them. The subject of the power of the Treasury to deal with this\nmatter without further legislation has been under consideration, but\ncircumstances have postponed a conclusion. It is probable that a\nconsideration of the propriety of a modification or abrogation of the\narticle of the treaty of Washington relating to the transit of goods in\nbond is involved in any complete solution of the question.Congress at the last session was kept advised of the progress of the\nserious and for a time threatening difference between the United States and\nChile. It gives me now great gratification to report that the Chilean\nGovernment in a most friendly and honorable spirit has tendered and paid as\nan indemnity to the families of the sailors of the Baltimore who were\nkilled and to those who were injured in the outbreak in the city of\nValparaiso the sum of $75,000. This has been accepted not only as an\nindemnity for a wrong done, but as a most gratifying evidence that the\nGovernment of Chile rightly appreciates the disposition of this Government\nto act in a spirit of the most absolute fairness and friendliness in our\nintercourse with that brave people. A further and conclusive evidence of\nthe mutual respect and confidence now existing is furnished by the fact\nthat a convention submitting to arbitration the mutual claims of the\ncitizens of the respective Governments has been agreed upon. Some of these\nclaims have been pending for many years and have been the occasion of much\nunsatisfactory diplomatic correspondence.I have endeavored in every way to assure our sister Republics of Central\nand South America that the United States Government and its people have\nonly the most friendly disposition toward them all. We do not covet their\nterritory. We have no disposition to be oppressive or exacting in our\ndealings with any of them, even the weakest. Our interests and our hopes\nfor them all lie in the direction of stable governments by their people and\nof the largest development of their great commercial resources. The mutual\nbenefits of enlarged commercial exchanges and of a more familiar and\nfriendly intercourse between our peoples we do desire, and in this have\nsought their friendly cooperation.I have believed, however, while holding these sentiments in the greatest\nsincerity, that we must insist upon a just responsibility for any injuries\ninflicted upon our official representatives or upon our citizens. This\ninsistence, kindly and justly but firmly made, will, I believe, promote\npeace and mutual respect.Our relations with Hawaii have been such as to attract an increased\ninterest, and must continue to do so. I deem it of great importance that\nthe projected submarine cable, a survey for which has been made, should be\npromoted. Both for naval and commercial uses we should have quick\ncommunication with Honolulu. We should before this have availed ourselves\nof the concession made many years ago to this Government for a harbor and\nnaval station at Pearl River. Many evidences of the friendliness of the\nHawaiian Government have been given in the past, and it is gratifying to\nbelieve that the advantage and necessity of a continuance of very close\nrelations is appreciated.The friendly act of this Government in expressing to the Government of\nItaly its reprobation and abhorrence of the lynching of Italian subjects in\nNew Orleans by the payment of 125,000 francs, or $24,330.90, was accepted\nby the King of Italy with every manifestation of gracious appreciation, and\nthe incident has been highly promotive of mutual respect and good will.In consequence of the action of the French Government in proclaiming a\nprotectorate over certain tribal districts of the west coast of Africa\neastward of the San Pedro River, which has long been regarded as the\nsoutheastern boundary of Liberia, I have felt constrained to make protest\nagainst this encroachment upon the territory of a Republic which was\nrounded by citizens of the United States and toward which this country has\nfor many years held the intimate relation of a friendly counselor.The recent disturbances of the public peace by lawless foreign marauders on\nthe Mexican frontier have afforded this Government an opportunity to\ntestify its good will for Mexico and its earnest purpose to fulfill the\nobligations of international friendship by pursuing and dispersing the evil\ndoers. The work of relocating the boundary of the treaty of Guadalupe\nHidalgo westward from El Paso is progressing favorably.Our intercourse with Spain continues on a friendly footing. I regret,\nhowever, not to be able to report as yet the adjustment of the claims of\nthe American missionaries arising from the disorders at Ponape, in the\nCaroline Islands, but I anticipate a satisfactory adjustment in view of\nrenewed and urgent representations to the Government at Madrid.The treatment of the religious and educational establishments of American\ncitizens in Turkey has of late called for a more than usual share of\nattention. A tendency to curtail the toleration which has so beneficially\nprevailed is discernible and has called forth the earnest remonstrance of\nthis Government. Harassing regulations in regard to schools and churches\nhave been attempted in certain localities, but not without due protest and\nthe assertion of the inherent and conventional rights of our countrymen.\nViolations of domicile and search of the persons and effects of citizens of\nthe United States by apparently irresponsible officials in the Asiatic\nvilayets have from time to time been reported. An aggravated instance of\ninjury to the property of an American missionary at Bourdour, in the\nprovince of Konia, called forth an urgent claim for reparation, which I am\npleased to say was promptly heeded by the Government of the Porte.\nInterference with the trading ventures of our citizens in Asia Minor is\nalso reported, and the lack of consular representation in that region is a\nserious drawback to instant and effective protection. I can not believe\nthat these incidents represent a settled policy, and shall not cease to\nurge the adoption of proper remedies.International copyright has been extended to Italy by proclamation in\nconformity with the act of March 3, 1891, upon assurance being given that\nItalian law permits to citizens of the United States the benefit of\ncopyright on substantially the same basis as to subjects of Italy. By a\nspecial convention proclaimed January 15, 1892, reciprocal provisions of\ncopyright have been applied between the United States and Germany.\nNegotiations are in progress with other countries to the same end.I repeat with great earnestness the recommendation which I have made in\nseveral previous messages that prompt and adequate support be given to the\nAmerican company engaged in the construction of the Nicaragua ship canal.\nIt is impossible to overstate the value from every standpoint of this great\nenterprise, and I hope that there may be time, even in this Congress, to\ngive to it an impetus that will insure the early completion of the canal\nand secure to the United States its proper relation to it when completed.The Congress has been already advised that the invitations of this\nGovernment for the assembling of an international monetary conference to\nconsider the question of an enlarged use of silver were accepted by the\nnations to which they were addressed. The conference assembled at Brussels\non the 22d of November, and has entered upon the consideration of this\ngreat question. I have not doubted, and have taken occasion to express that\nbelief as well in the invitations issued for this conference as in my\npublic messages, that the free coinage of silver upon an agreed\ninternational ratio would greatly promote the interests of our people and\nequally those of other nations. It is too early to predict what results may\nbe accomplished by the conference. If any temporary check or delay\nintervenes, I believe that very soon commercial conditions will compel the\nnow reluctant governments to unite with us in this movement to secure the\nenlargement of the volume of coined money needed for the transaction of the\nbusiness of the world.The report of the Secretary of the Treasury will attract especial interest\nin view of the many misleading statements that have been made as to the\nstate of the public revenues. Three preliminary facts should not only be\nstated but emphasized before looking into details: First, that the public\ndebt has been reduced since March 4, 1889, $259,074,200, and the annual\ninterest charge $11,684,469; second, that there have been paid out for\npensions during this Administration up to November 1, 1892,\n$432,564,178.70, an excess of $114,466,386.09 over the sum expended during\nthe period from March 1, 1885, to March 1, 1889; and, third, that under the\nexisting tariff up to December 1 about $93,000,000 of revenue which would\nhave been collected upon imported sugars if the duty had been maintained\nhas gone into the pockets of the people, and not into the public Treasury,\nas before. If there are any who still think that the surplus should have\nbeen kept out of circulation by hoarding it in the Treasury, or deposited\nin favored banks without interest while the Government continued to pay to\nthese very banks interest upon the bonds deposited as security for the\ndeposits, or who think that the extended pension legislation was a public\nrobbery, or that the duties upon sugar should have been maintained, I am\ncontent to leave the argument where it now rests while we wait to see\nwhether these criticisms will take the form of legislation.The revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, from all sources\nwere $425,868,260.22, and the expenditures for all purposes were\n$415,953,806.56, leaving a balance of $9,914,453.66. There were paid during\nthe year upon the public debt $40,570,467.98. The surplus in the Treasury\nand the bank redemption fund passed by the act of July 14, 1890, to the\ngeneral fund furnished in large part the cash available and used for the\npayments made upon the public debt. Compared with the year 1891, our\nreceipts from customs duties fell off $42,069,241.08, while our receipts\nfrom internal revenue increased $8,284,823.13, leaving the net loss of\nrevenue from these principal sources $33,784,417.95. The net loss of\nrevenue from all sources was $32,675,972.81.The revenues, estimated and actual, for the fiscal year ending June 30,\n1893, are placed by the Secretary at $463,336,350.44, and the expenditures\nat $461,336,350.44, showing a surplus of receipts over expenditures of\n$2,000,000. The cash balance in the Treasury at the end of the fiscal year\nit is estimated will be $20,992,377.03. So far as these figures are based\nupon estimates of receipts and expenditures for the remaining months of the\ncurrent fiscal year, there are not only the usual elements of uncertainty,\nbut some added elements. New revenue legislation, or even the expectation\nof it, may seriously reduce the public revenues during the period of\nuncertainty and during the process of business adjustment to the new\nconditions when they become known. But the Secretary has very wisely\nrefrained from guessing as to the effect of possible changes in our revenue\nlaws, since the scope of those changes and the time of their taking effect\ncan not in any degree be forecast or foretold by him. His estimates must be\nbased upon existing laws and upon a continuance of existing business\nconditions, except so far as these conditions may be affected by causes\nother than new legislation.The estimated receipts for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, are\n$490,121,365.38, and the estimated appropriations $457,261,335.33, leaving\nan estimated surplus of receipts over expenditures of $32,860,030.05. This\ndoes not include any payment to the sinking fund. In the recommendation of\nthe Secretary that the sinking-fund law be repealed I concur. The\nredemption of bonds since the passage of the law to June 30, 1892, has\nalready exceeded the requirements by the sum of $990,510,681.49. The\nretirement of bonds in the future before maturity should be a matter of\nconvenience, not of compulsion. We should not collect revenue for that\npurpose, but only use any casual surplus. To the balance of $32,860,030.05\nof receipts over expenditures for the year 1894 should be added the\nestimated surplus at the beginning of the year, $20,992,377.03, and from\nthis aggregate there must be deducted, as stated by the Secretary, about\n$44,000,000 of estimated unexpended appropriations.The public confidence in the purpose and ability of the Government to\nmaintain the parity of all of our money issues, whether coin or paper, must\nremain unshaken. The demand for gold in Europe and the consequent calls\nupon us are in a considerable degree the result of the efforts of some of\nthe European Governments to increase their gold reserves, and these efforts\nshould be met by appropriate legislation on our part. The conditions that\nhave created this drain of the Treasury gold are in an important degree\npolitical, and not commercial. In view of the fact that a general revision\nof our revenue laws in the near future seems to be probable, it would be\nbetter that any changes should be a part of that revision rather than of a\ntemporary nature.During the last fiscal year the Secretary purchased under the act of July\n14, 1890, 54,355,748 ounces of silver and issued in payment therefor\n$51,106,608 in notes. The total purchases since the passage of the act have\nbeen 120,479,981 ounces and the aggregate of notes issued $116,783,590. The\naverage price paid for silver during the year was 94 cents per ounce, the\nhighest price being $1.02 3/4 July 1, 1891, and the lowest 83 cents March\n21, 1892. In view of the fact that the monetary conference is now sitting\nand that no conclusion has yet been reached, I withhold any recommendation\nas to legislation upon this subject.The report of the Secretary of War brings again to the attention of\nCongress some important suggestions as to the reorganization of the\ninfantry and artillery arms of the service, which his predecessors have\nbefore urgently presented. Our Army is small, but its organization should\nall the more be put upon the most approved modern basis. The conditions\nupon what we have called the \"frontier\" have heretofore required the\nmaintenance of many small posts, but now the policy of concentration is\nobviously the right one. The new posts should have the proper strategic\nrelations to the only \"frontiers\" we now have--those of the seacoast and of\nour northern and part of our southern boundary. I do not think that any\nquestion of advantage to localities or to States should determine the\nlocation of the new posts. The reorganization and enlargement of the Bureau\nof Military Information which the Secretary has effected is a work the\nusefulness of which will become every year more apparent. The work of\nbuilding heavy guns and the construction of coast defenses has been well\nbegun and should be carried on without check.The report of the Attorney-General is by law submitted directly to\nCongress, but I can not refrain from saying that he has conducted the\nincreasing work of the Department of Justice with great professional skill.\nHe has in several directions secured from the courts decisions giving\nincreased protection to the officers of the United States and bringing some\nclasses of crime that escaped local cognizance and punishment into the\ntribunals of the United States, where they could be tried with\nimpartiality.The numerous applications for Executive clemency presented in behalf of\npersons convicted in United States courts and given penitentiary sentences\nhave called my attention to a fact referred to by the Attorney-General in\nhis report, namely, that a time allowance for good behavior for such\nprisoners is prescribed by the Federal statutes only where the State in\nwhich the penitentiary is located has made no such provision. Prisoners are\ngiven the benefit of the provisions of the State law regulating the\npenitentiary to which they may be sent. These are various, some perhaps too\nliberal and some perhaps too illiberal. The result is that a sentence for\nfive years means one thing if the prisoner is sent to one State for\nconfinement and quite a different thing if he is sent to another. I\nrecommend that a uniform credit for good behavior be prescribed by\nCongress.I have before expressed my concurrence in the recommendation of the\nAttorney-General that degrees of murder should be recognized in the Federal\nstatutes, as they are, I believe, in all the States. These grades are\nrounded on correct distinctions in crime. The recognition of them would\nenable the courts to exercise some discretion in apportioning punishment\nand would greatly relieve the Executive of what is coming to be a very\nheavy burden--the examination of these cases on application for\ncommutation.The aggregate of claims pending against the Government in the Court of\nClaims is enormous. Claims to the amount of nearly $400,000,000 for the\ntaking of or injury to the property of persons claiming to be loyal during\nthe war are now before that court for examination. When to these are added\nthe Indian depredation claims and the French spoliation claims, an\naggregate is reached that is indeed startling. In the defense of all these\ncases the Government is at great disadvantage. The claimants have preserved\ntheir evidence, whereas the agents of the Government are sent into the\nfield to rummage for what they can find. This difficulty is peculiarly\ngreat where the fact to be established is the disloyalty of the claimant\nduring the war. If this great threat against our revenues is to have no\nother check, certainly Congress should supply the Department of Justice\nwith appropriations sufficiently liberal to secure the best legal talent in\nthe defense of these claims and to pursue its vague search for evidence\neffectively.The report of the Postmaster-General shows a most gratifying increase and a\nmost efficient and progressive management of the great business of that\nDepartment. The remarkable increase in revenues, in the number of\npost-offices, and in the miles of mail carriage furnishes further evidence\nof the high state of prosperity which our people are enjoying. New offices\nmean new hamlets and towns, new routes mean the extension of our border\nsettlements, and increased revenues mean an active commerce. The\nPostmaster-General reviews the whole period of his administration of the\noffice and brings some of his statistics down to the month of November\nlast. The postal revenues have increased during the last year nearly\n$5,000,000. The deficit for the year ending June 30, 1892, is $848,341 less\nthan the deficiency of the preceding year. The deficiency of the present\nfiscal year it is estimated will be reduced to $1,552,423, which will not\nonly be extinguished during the next fiscal year but a surplus of nearly\n$1,000,000 should then be shown. In these calculations the payments to be\nmade under the contracts for ocean mail service have not been included.\nThere have been added 1,590 new mail routes during the year, with a mileage\nof 8,563 miles, and the total number of new miles of mail trips added\nduring the year is nearly 17,000,000. The number of miles of mail journeys\nadded during the last four years is about 76,000,000, this addition being\n21,000,000 miles more than were in operation in the whole country in 1861.The number of post-offices has been increased by 2,790 during the year, and\nduring the past four years, and up to October 29 last, the total increase\nin the number of offices has been nearly 9,000. The number of free-delivery\noffices has been nearly doubled in the last four years, and the number of\nmoney-order offices more than doubled within that time.For the three years ending June 30, 1892, the postal revenue amounted to\n$197,744,359, which was an increase of $52,263,150 over the revenue for the\nthree years ending June 30, 1888, the increase during the last three years\nbeing more than three and a half times as great as the increase during the\nthree years ending June 30, 1888. No such increase as that shown for these\nthree years has ever previously appeared in the revenues of the Department.\nThe Postmaster-General has extended to the post-offices in the larger\ncities the merit system of promotion introduced by my direction into the\nDepartments here, and it has resulted there, as in the Departments, in a\nlarger volume of work and that better done.Ever since our merchant marine was driven from the sea by the rebel\ncruisers during the War of the Rebellion the United States has been paying\nan enormous annual tribute to foreign countries in the shape of freight and\npassage moneys. Our grain and meats have been taken at our own docks and\nour large imports there laid down by foreign shipmasters. An increasing\ntorrent of American travel to Europe has contributed a vast sum annually to\nthe dividends of foreign shipowners. The balance of trade shown by the\nbooks of our custom-houses has been very largely reduced and in many years\naltogether extinguished by this constant drain. In the year 1892 only 12.3\nper cent of our imports were brought in American vessels. These great\nforeign steamships maintained by our traffic are many of them under\ncontracts with their respective Governments by which in time of war they\nwill become a part of their armed naval establishments. Profiting by our\ncommerce in peace, they will become the most formidable destroyers of our\ncommerce in time of war. I have felt, and have before expressed the\nfeeling, that this condition of things was both intolerable and\ndisgraceful. A wholesome change of policy, and one having in it much\npromise, as it seems to me, was begun by the law of March 3, 1891. Under\nthis law contracts have been made by the Postmaster-General for eleven mail\nroutes. The expenditure involved by these contracts for the next fiscal\nyear approximates $954,123.33. As one of the results already reached\nsixteen American steamships, of an aggregate tonnage of 57,400 tons,\ncosting $7,400,000, have been built or contracted to be built in American\nshipyards.The estimated tonnage of all steamships required under existing contracts\nis 165,802, and when the full service required by these contracts is\nestablished there will be forty-one mail steamers under the American flag,\nwith the probability of further necessary additions in the Brazilian and\nArgentine service. The contracts recently let for transatlantic service\nwill result in the construction of five ships of 10,000 tons each, costing\n$9,000,000 to $10,000,000, and will add, with the City of New York and City\nof Paris, to which the Treasury Department was authorized by legislation at\nthe last session to give American registry, seven of the swiftest vessels\nupon the sea to our naval reserve. The contracts made with the lines\nsailing to Central and South American ports have increased the frequency\nand shortened the time of the trips, added new ports of call, and sustained\nsome lines that otherwise would almost certainly have been withdrawn. The\nservice to Buenos Ayres is the first to the Argentine Republic under the\nAmerican flag. The service to Southampton, Boulogne, and Antwerp is also\nnew, and is to be begun with the steamships City of New York and City of\nParis in February next.I earnestly urge the continuance of the policy inaugurated by this\nlegislation, and that the appropriations required to meet the obligations\nof the Government under the contracts may be made promptly, so that the\nlines that have entered into these engagements may not be embarrassed. We\nhave had, by reason of connections with the transcontinental railway lines\nconstructed through our own territory, some advantages in the ocean trade\nof the Pacific that we did not possess on the Atlantic. The construction of\nthe Canadian Pacific Railway and the establishment under large subventions\nfrom Canada and England of fast steamship service from Vancouver with Japan\nand China seriously threaten our shipping interests in the Pacific. This\nline of English steamers receives, as is stated by the Commissioner of\nNavigation, a direct subsidy of $400,000 annually, or $30,767 per trip for\nthirteen voyages, in addition to some further aid from the Admiralty in\nconnection with contracts under which the vessels may be used for naval\npurposes. The competing American Pacific mail line under the act of March\n3, 1891, receives only $6,389 per round trip.Efforts have been making within the last year, as I am informed, to\nestablish under similar conditions a line between Vancouver and some\nAustralian port, with a view of seizing there a trade in which we have had\na large interest. The Commissioner of Navigation states that a very large\nper cent of our imports from Asia are now brought to us by English\nsteamships and their connecting railways in Canada. With a view of\npromoting this trade, especially in tea, Canada has imposed a\ndiscriminating duty of 10 per cent upon tea and coffee brought into the\nDominion from the United States. If this unequal contest between American\nlines without subsidy, or with diminished subsidies, and the English\nCanadian line to which I have referred is to continue, I think we should at\nleast see that the facilities for customs entry and transportation across\nour territory are not such as to make the Canadian route a favored one, and\nthat the discrimination as to duties to which I have referred is met by a\nlike discrimination as to the importation of these articles from Canada.No subject, I think, more nearly touches the pride, the power, and the\nprosperity of our country than this of the development of our merchant\nmarine upon the sea. If we could enter into conference with other\ncompetitors and all would agree to withhold government aid, we could\nperhaps take our chances with the rest; but our great competitors have\nestablished and maintained their lines by government subsidies until they\nnow have practically excluded us from participation. In my opinion no\nchoice is left to us but to pursue, moderately at least, the same lines.The report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits great progress in the\nconstruction of our new Navy. When the present Secretary entered upon his\nduties, only 3 modern steel vessels were in commission. The vessels since\nput in commission and to be put in commission during the winter will make a\ntotal of 19 during his administration of the Department. During the current\nyear 10 war vessels and 3 navy tugs have been launched, and during the four\nyears 25 vessels will have been launched. Two other large ships and a\ntorpedo boat are under contract and the work upon them well advanced, and\nthe 4 monitors are awaiting only the arrival of their armor, which has been\nunexpectedly delayed, or they would have been before this in commission.Contracts have been let during this Administration, under the\nappropriations for the increase of the Navy, including new vessels and\ntheir appurtenances, to the amount of $35,000,000, and there has been\nexpended during the same period for labor at navy-yards upon similar work\n$8,000,000 without the smallest scandal or charge of fraud or partiality.\nThe enthusiasm and interest of our naval officers, both of the staff and\nline, have been greatly kindled. They have responded magnificently to the\nconfidence of Congress and have demonstrated to the world an unexcelled\ncapacity in construction, in ordnance, and in everything involved in the\nbuilding, equipping, and sailing of great war ships.At the beginning of Secretary Tracy's administration several difficult\nproblems remained to be grappled with and solved before the efficiency in\naction of our ships could be secured. It is believed that as the result of\nnew processes in the construction of armor plate our later ships will be\nclothed with defensive plates of higher resisting power than are found on\nany war vessels afloat. We were without torpedoes. Tests have been made to\nascertain the relative efficiency of different constructions, a torpedo has\nbeen adopted, and the work of construction is now being carried on\nsuccessfully. We were without armor-piercing shells and without a shop\ninstructed and equipped for the construction of them. We are now making\nwhat is believed to be a projectile superior to any before in use. A\nsmokeless powder has been developed and a slow-burning powder for guns of\nlarge caliber. A high explosive capable of use in shells fired from service\nguns has been found, and the manufacture of gun cotton has been developed\nso that the question of supply is no longer in doubt.The development of a naval militia, which has been organized in eight\nStates and brought into cordial and cooperative relations with the Navy, is\nanother important achievement. There are now enlisted in these\norganizations 1,800 men, and they are likely to be greatly extended. I\nrecommend such legislation and appropriations as will encourage and develop\nthis movement. The recommendations of the Secretary will, I do not doubt,\nreceive the friendly consideration of Congress, for he has enjoyed, as he\nhas deserved, the confidence of all those interested in the development of\nour Navy, without any division upon partisan lines. I earnestly express the\nhope that a work which has made such noble progress may not now be stayed.\nThe wholesome influence for peace and the increased sense of security which\nour citizens domiciled in other lands feel when these magnificent ships\nunder the American flag appear is already most gratefully apparent. The\nships from our Navy which will appear in the great naval parade next April\nin the harbor of New York will be a convincing demonstration to the world\nthat the United States is again a naval power.The work of the Interior Department, always very burdensome, has been\nlarger than ever before during the administration of Secretary Noble. The\ndisability-pension law, the taking of the Eleventh Census, the opening of\nvast areas of Indian lands to settlement, the organization of Oklahoma, and\nthe negotiations for the cession of Indian lands furnish some of the\nparticulars of the increased work, and the results achieved testify to the\nability, fidelity, and industry of the head of the Department and his\nefficient assistants.Several important agreements for the cession of Indian lands negotiated by\nthe commission appointed under the act of March 2, 1889, are awaiting the\naction of Congress. Perhaps the most important of these is that for the\ncession of the Cherokee Strip. This region has been the source of great\nvexation to the executive department and of great friction and unrest\nbetween the settlers who desire to occupy it and the Indians who assert\ntitle. The agreement which has been made by the commission is perhaps the\nmost satisfactory that could have been reached. It will be noticed that it\nis conditioned upon its ratification by Congress before March 4, 1893. The\nSecretary of the Interior, who has given the subject very careful thought,\nrecommends the ratification of the agreement, and I am inclined to follow\nhis recommendation. Certain it is that some action by which this\ncontroversy shall be brought to an end and these lands opened to settlement\nis urgent.The form of government provided by Congress on May 17, 1884, for Alaska was\nin its frame and purpose temporary. The increase of population and the\ndevelopment of some important mining and commercial interests make it\nimperative that the law should be revised and better provision made for the\narrest and punishment of criminals.The report of the Secretary shows a very gratifying state of facts as to\nthe condition of the General Land Office. The work of issuing agricultural\npatents, which seemed to be hopelessly in arrear when the present Secretary\nundertook the duties of his office, has been so expedited that the bureau\nis now upon current business. The relief thus afforded to honest and worthy\nsettlers upon the public lands by giving to them an assured title to their\nentries has been of incalculable benefit in developing the new States and\nthe Territories.The Court of Private Land Claims, established by Congress for the promotion\nof this policy of speedily settling contested land titles, is making\nsatisfactory progress in its work, and when the work is completed a great\nimpetus will be given to the development of those regions where unsettled\nclaims under Mexican grants have so long exercised their repressive\ninfluence. When to these results are added the enormous cessions of Indian\nlands which have been opened to settlement, aggregating during this\nAdministration nearly 26,000,000 acres, and the agreements negotiated and\nnow pending in Congress for ratification by which about 10,000,000\nadditional acres will be opened to settlement, it will be seen how much has\nbeen accomplished.The work in the Indian Bureau in the execution of the policy of recent\nlegislation has been largely directed to two chief purposes: First, the\nallotment of lands in severalty to the Indians and the cession to the\nUnited States of the surplus lands, and, secondly, to the work of educating\nthe Indian for his own protection in his closer contact with the white man\nand for the intelligent exercise of his new citizenship. Allotments have\nbeen made and patents issued to 5,900 Indians under the present Secretary\nand Commissioner, and 7,600 additional allotments have been made for which\npatents are now in process of preparation. The school attendance of Indian\nchildren has been increased during that time over 13 per cent, the\nenrollment for 1892 being nearly 20,000. A uniform system of school\ntext-books and of study has been adopted and the work in these national\nschools brought as near as may be to the basis of the free common schools\nof the States. These schools can be transferred and merged into the\ncommon-school systems of the States when the Indian has fully assumed his\nnew relation to the organized civil community in which he resides and the\nnew States are able to assume the burden. I have several times been called\nupon to remove Indian agents appointed by me, and have done so promptly\nupon every sustained complaint of unfitness or misconduct. I believe,\nhowever, that the Indian service at the agencies has been improved and is\nnow administered on the whole with a good degree of efficiency. If any\nlegislation is possible by which the selection of Indian agents can be\nwholly removed from all partisan suggestions or considerations, I am sure\nit would be a great relief to the Executive and a great benefit to the\nservice. The appropriation for the subsistence of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe\nIndians made at the last session of Congress was inadequate. This smaller\nappropriation was estimated for by the Commissioner upon the theory that\nthe large fund belonging to the tribe in the public Treasury could be and\nought to be used for their support. In view, however, of the pending\ndepredation claims against this fund and other considerations, the\nSecretary of the Interior on the 12th of April last submitted a\nsupplemental estimate for $50,000. This appropriation was not made, as it\nshould have been, and the oversight ought to be remedied at the earliest\npossible date.In a special message to this Congress at the last session, I stated the\nreasons why I had not approved the deed for the release to the United\nStates by the Choctaws and Chickasaws of the lands formerly embraced in the\nCheyenne and Arapahoe Reservation and remaining after allotments to that\ntribe. A resolution of the Senate expressing the opinion of that body that\nnotwithstanding the facts stated in my special message the deed should be\napproved and the money, $2,991,450, paid over was presented to me May 10,\n1892. My special message was intended to call the attention of Congress to\nthe subject, and in view of the fact that it is conceded that the\nappropriation proceeded upon a false basis as to the amount of lands to be\npaid for and is by $50,000 in excess of the amount they are entitled to\n(even if their claim to the land is given full recognition at the rate\nagreed upon), I have not felt willing to approve the deed, and shall not do\nso, at least until both Houses of Congress have acted upon the subject. It\nhas been informally proposed by the claimants to release this sum of\n$50,000, but I have no power to demand or accept such a release, and such\nan agreement would be without consideration and void.I desire further to call the attention of Congress to the fact that the\nrecent agreement concluded with the Kiowas and Comanches relates to lands\nwhich were a part of the \"leased district,\" and to which the claim of the\nChoctaws and Chickasaws is precisely that recognized by Congress in the\nlegislation I have referred to. The surplus lands to which this claim would\nattach in the Kiowa and Comanche Reservation is 2,500,000 acres, and at the\nsame rate the Government will be called upon to pay to the Choctaws and\nChickasaws for these lands $3,125,000. This sum will be further augmented,\nespecially if the title of the Indians to the tract now Greet County, Tex.,\nis established. The duty devolved upon me in this connection was simply to\npass upon the form of the deed; but as in my opinion the facts mentioned in\nmy special message were not adequately brought to the attention of Congress\nin connection with the legislation, I have felt that I would not be\njustified in acting without some new expression of the legislative will.The report of the Commissioner of Pensions, to which extended notice is\ngiven by the Secretary of the Interior in his report, will attract great\nattention. Judged by the aggregate amount of work done, the last year has\nbeen the greatest in the history of the office. I believe that the\norganization of the office is efficient and that the work has been done\nwith fidelity. The passage of what is known as the disability bill has, as\nwas foreseen, very largely increased the annual disbursements to the\ndisabled veterans of the Civil War. The estimate for this fiscal year was\n$144,956,000, and that amount was appropriated. A deficiency amounting to\n$10,508,621 must be provided for at this session. The estimate for pensions\nfor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, is $165,000,000. The Commissioner\nof Pensions believes that if the present legislation and methods are\nmaintained and further additions to the pension laws are not made the\nmaximum expenditure for pensions will be reached June 30, 1894, and will be\nat the highest point $188,000,000 per annum.I adhere to the views expressed in previous messages that the care of the\ndisabled soldiers of the War of the Rebellion is a matter of national\nconcern and duty. Perhaps no emotion cools sooner than that of gratitude,\nbut I can not believe that this process has yet reached a point with our\npeople that would sustain the policy of remitting the care of these\ndisabled veterans to the inadequate agencies provided by local laws. The\nparade on the 20th of September last upon the streets of this capital of\n60,000 of the surviving Union veterans of the War of the Rebellion was a\nmost touching and thrilling episode, and the rich and gracious welcome\nextended to them by the District of Columbia and the applause that greeted\ntheir progress from tens of thousands of people from all the States did\nmuch to revive the glorious recollections of the Grand Review when these\nmen and many thousand others now in their graves were welcomed with\ngrateful joy as victors in a struggle in which the national unity, honor,\nand wealth were all at issue.In my last annual message I called attention to the fact that some\nlegislative action was necessary in order to protect the interests of the\nGovernment in its relations with the Union Pacific Railway. The\nCommissioner of Railroads has submitted a very full report, giving exact\ninformation as to the debt, the liens upon the company's property, and its\nresources. We must deal with the question as we find it and take that\ncourse which will under existing conditions best secure the interests of\nthe United States. I recommended in my last annual message that a\ncommission be appointed to deal with this question, and I renew that\nrecommendation and suggest that the commission be given full power.The report of the Secretary of Agriculture contains not only a most\ninteresting statement of the progressive and valuable work done under the\nadministration of Secretary Rusk, but many suggestions for the enlarged\nusefulness of this important Department. In the successful efforts to break\ndown the restrictions to the free introduction of our meat products in the\ncountries of Europe the Secretary has been untiring from the first,\nstimulating and aiding all other Government officers at home and abroad\nwhose official duties enabled them to participate in the work. The total\ntrade in hog products with Europe in May, 1892, amounted to 82,000,000\npounds, against 46,900,000 in the same month of 1891; in June, 1892, the\nexport aggregated 85,700,000 pounds, against 46,500,000 pounds in the same\nmonth of the previous year; in July there was an increase of 41 per cent\nand in August of 55 per cent over the corresponding months of 1891. Over\n40,000,000 pounds of inspected pork have been exported since the law was\nput into operation, and a comparison of the four months of May, June, July,\nand August, 1892, with the same months of 1891 shows an increase in the\nnumber of pounds of our export of pork products of 62 per cent and an\nincrease in value of 66 1/2 per cent. The exports of dressed beef increased\nfrom 137,900,000 pounds in 1889 to 220,500,000 pounds in 1892 or about 60\nper cent. During the past year there have been exported 394,607 head of\nlive cattle, as against 205,786 exported in 1889. This increased\nexportation has been largely promoted by the inspection authorized by law\nand the faithful efforts of the Secretary and his efficient subordinates to\nmake that inspection thorough and to carefully exclude from all cargoes\ndiseased or suspected cattle. The requirement of the English regulations\nthat live cattle arriving from the United States must be slaughtered at the\ndocks had its origin in the claim that pleuro-pneumonia existed among\nAmerican cattle and that the existence of the disease could only certainly\nbe determined by a post mortem inspection.The Department of Agriculture has labored with great energy and\nfaithfulness to extirpate this disease, and on the 26th day of September\nlast a public announcement was made by the Secretary that the disease no\nlonger existed anywhere within the United States. He is entirely satisfied\nafter the most searching inquiry that this statement was justified, and\nthat by a continuance of the inspection and quarantine now required of\ncattle brought into this country the disease can be prevented from again\ngetting any foothold. The value to the cattle industry of the United States\nof this achievement can hardly be estimated. We can not, perhaps, at once\ninsist that this evidence shall be accepted as satisfactory by other\ncountries; but if the present exemption from the disease is maintained and\nthe inspection of our cattle arriving at foreign ports, in which our own\nveterinarians participate, confirms it, we may justly expect that the\nrequirement that our cattle shall be slaughtered at the docks will be\nrevoked, as the sanitary restrictions upon our pork products have been. If\nour cattle can be taken alive to the interior, the trade will be enormously\nincreased.Agricultural products constituted 78.1 per cent of our unprecedented\nexports for the fiscal year which closed June 30, 1892, the total exports\nbeing $1,030,278,030 and the value of the agricultural products\n$793,717,676, which exceeds by more than $150,000,000 the shipment of\nagricultural products in any previous year.An interesting and a promising work for the benefit of the American farmer\nhas been begun through agents of the Agricultural Department in Europe, and\nconsists in efforts to introduce the various products of Indian corn as\narticles of human food. The high price of rye offered a favorable\nopportunity for the experiment in Germany of combining corn meal with rye\nto produce a cheaper bread. A fair degree of success has been attained, and\nsome mills for grinding corn for food have been introduced. The Secretary\nis of the opinion that this new use of the products of corn has already\nstimulated exportations, and that if diligently prosecuted large and\nimportant markets can presently be opened for this great American product.The suggestions of the Secretary for an enlargement of the work of the\nDepartment are commended to your favorable consideration. It may, I think,\nbe said without challenge that in no corresponding period has so much been\ndone as during the last four years for the benefit of American\nagriculture.The subject of quarantine regulations, inspection, and control was brought\nsuddenly to my attention by the arrival at our ports in August last of\nvessels infected with cholera. Quarantine regulations should be uniform at\nall our ports. Under the Constitution they are plainly within the exclusive\nFederal jurisdiction when and so far as Congress shall legislate. In my\nopinion the whole subject should be taken into national control and\nadequate power given to the Executive to protect our people against plague\ninvasions. On the 1st of September last I approved regulations establishing\na twenty-day quarantine for all vessels bringing immigrants from foreign\nports. This order will be continued in force. Some loss and suffering have\nresulted to passengers, but a due care for the homes of our people\njustifies in such cases the utmost precaution. There is danger that with\nthe coming of spring cholera will again appear, and a liberal appropriation\nshould be made at this session to enable our quarantine and port officers\nto exclude the deadly plague.But the most careful and stringent quarantine regulations may not be\nsufficient absolutely to exclude the disease. The progress of medical and\nsanitary science has been such, however, that if approved precautions are\ntaken at once to put all of our cities and towns in the best sanitary\ncondition, and provision is made for isolating any sporadic cases and for a\nthorough disinfection, an epidemic can, I am sure, be avoided. This work\nappertains to the local authorities, and the responsibility and the penalty\nwill be appalling if it is neglected or unduly delayed.We are peculiarly subject in our great ports to the spread of infectious\ndiseases by reason of the fact that unrestricted immigration brings to us\nout of European cities, in the overcrowded steerages of great steamships, a\nlarge number of persons whose surroundings make them the easy victims of\nthe plague. This consideration, as well as those affecting the political,\nmoral, and industrial interests of our country, leads me to renew the\nsuggestion that admission to our country and to the high privileges of its\ncitizenship should be more restricted and more careful. We have, I think, a\nright and owe a duty to our own people, and especially to our working\npeople, not only to keep out the vicious, the ignorant, the civil\ndisturber, the pauper, and the contract laborer, but to check the too great\nflow of immigration now coming by further limitations.The report of the World's Columbian Exposition has not yet been submitted.\nThat of the board of management of the Government exhibit has been received\nand is herewith transmitted. The work of construction and of preparation\nfor the opening of the exposition in May next has progressed most\nsatisfactorily and upon a scale of liberality and magnificence that will\nworthily sustain the honor of the United States.The District of Columbia is left by a decision of the supreme court of the\nDistrict without any law regulating the liquor traffic. An old statute of\nthe legislature of the District relating to the licensing of various\nvocations has hitherto been treated by the Commissioners as giving them\npower to grant or refuse licenses to sell intoxicating liquors and as\nsubjecting those who sold without licenses to penalties; but in May last\nthe supreme court of the District held against this view of the powers of\nthe Commissioners. It is of urgent importance, therefore, that Congress\nshould supply, either by direct enactment or by conferring discretionary\npowers upon the Commissioners, proper limitations and restraints upon the\nliquor traffic in the District. The District has suffered in its reputation\nby many crimes of violence, a large per cent of them resulting from\ndrunkenness and the liquor traffic. The capital of the nation should be\nfreed from this reproach by the enactment of stringent restrictions and\nlimitations upon the traffic.In renewing the recommendation which I have made in three preceding annual\nmessages that Congress should legislate for the protection of railroad\nemployees against the dangers incident to the old and inadequate methods of\nbraking and coupling which are still in use upon freight trains, I do so\nwith the hope that this Congress may take action upon the subject.\nStatistics furnished by the Interstate Commerce Commission show that during\nthe year ending June 30, 1891, there were forty-seven different styles of\ncar couplers reported to be in use, and that during the same period there\nwere 2,660 employees killed and 26,140 injured. Nearly 16 per cent of the\ndeaths occurred in the coupling and uncoupling of cars and over 36 per cent\nof the injuries had the same origin.The Civil Service Commission ask for an increased appropriation for needed\nclerical assistance, which I think should be given. I extended the\nclassified service March 1, 1892, to include physicians, superintendents,\nassistant superintendents, school-teachers, and matrons in the Indian\nservice, and have had under consideration the subject of some further\nextensions, but have not as yet fully determined the lines upon which\nextensions can most properly and usefully be made.I have in each of the three annual messages which it has been my duty to\nsubmit to Congress called attention to the evils and dangers connected with\nour election methods and practices as they are related to the choice of\nofficers of the National Government. In my last annual message I endeavored\nto invoke serious attention to the evils of unfair apportionments for\nCongress. I can not close this message without again calling attention to\nthese grave and threatening evils. I had hoped that it was possible to\nsecure a nonpartisan inquiry by means of a commission into evils the\nexistence of which is known to all, and that out of this might grow\nlegislation from which all thought of partisan advantage should be\neliminated and only the higher thought appear of maintaining the freedom\nand purity of the ballot and the equality of the elector, without the\nguaranty of which the Government could never have been formed and without\nthe continuance of which it can not continue to exist in peace and\nprosperity.It is time that mutual charges of unfairness and fraud between the great\nparties should cease and that the sincerity of those who profess a desire\nfor pure and honest elections should be brought to the test of their\nwillingness to free our legislation and our election methods from\neverything that tends to impair the public confidence in the announced\nresult. The necessity for an inquiry and for legislation by Congress upon\nthis subject is emphasized by the fact that the tendency of the legislation\nin some States in recent years has in some important particulars been away\nfrom and not toward free and fair elections and equal apportionments. Is it\nnot time that we should come together upon the high plane of patriotism\nwhile we devise methods that shall secure the right of every man qualified\nby law to cast a free ballot and give to every such ballot an equal value\nin choosing our public officers and in directing the policy of the\nGovernment?Lawlessness is not less such, but more, where it usurps the functions of\nthe peace officer and of the courts. The frequent lynching of colored\npeople accused of crime is without the excuse, which has sometimes been\nurged by mobs for a failure to pursue the appointed methods for the\npunishment of crime, that the accused have an undue influence over courts\nand juries. Such acts are a reproach to the community where they occur, and\nso far as they can be made the subject of Federal jurisdiction the\nstrongest repressive legislation is demanded. A public sentiment that will\nsustain the officers of the law in resisting mobs and in protecting accused\npersons in their custody should be promoted by every possible means. The\nofficer who gives his life in the brave discharge of this duty is worthy of\nspecial honor. No lesson needs to be so urgently impressed upon our people\nas this, that no worthy end or cause can be promoted by lawlessness.This exhibit of the work of the Executive Departments is submitted to\nCongress and to the public in the hope that there will be found in it a due\nsense of responsibility and an earnest purpose to maintain the national\nhonor and to promote the happiness and prosperity of all our people, and\nthis brief exhibit of the growth and prosperity of the country will give us\na level from which to note the increase or decadence that new legislative\npolicies may bring to us. There is no reason why the national influence,\npower, and prosperity should not observe the same rates of increase that\nhave characterized the past thirty years. We carry the great impulse and\nincrease of these years into the future. There is no reason why in many\nlines of production we should not surpass all other nations, as we have\nalready done in some. There are no near frontiers to our possible\ndevelopment. Retrogression would be a crime.BENJ. HARRISON",
