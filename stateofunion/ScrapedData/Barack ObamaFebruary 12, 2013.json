    "speech": "Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, fellow citizens:Fifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy declared to this Chamber that \"the\nConstitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress.\" \"It\nis my task,\" he said, \"to report the State of the Union -- to improve it\nis the task of us all.\"Tonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people,\nthere is much progress to report. After a decade of grinding war, our\nbrave men and women in uniform are coming home. After years of grueling\nrecession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs. We buy\nmore American cars than we have in five years, and less foreign oil than\nwe have in twenty. Our housing market is healing, our stock market is\nrebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger\nprotections than ever before.Together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and can say with\nrenewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger.But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose\nhard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded. Our economy is\nadding jobs -- but too many people still can't find full-time employment.\nCorporate profits have rocketed to all-time highs -- but for more than a\ndecade, wages and incomes have barely budged.It is our generation's task, then, to reignite the true engine of\nAmerica's economic growth -- a rising, thriving middle class.It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this\ncountry -- the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities,\nyou can get ahead, no matter where you come from, what you look like, or\nwho you love.It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on\nbehalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free\nenterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of\nopportunity to every child across this great nation.The American people don't expect government to solve every problem. They\ndon't expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue. But\nthey do expect us to put the nation's interests before party. They do\nexpect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can. For they know\nthat America moves forward only when we do so together; and that the\nresponsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all.Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget --\ndecisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery.Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the\ndeficit by more than $2.5 trillion -- mostly through spending cuts, but\nalso by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. As a\nresult, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in\ndeficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.Now we need to finish the job. And the question is, how?In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn't\nagree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars'\nworth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year. These\nsudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness.\nThey'd devastate priorities like education, energy, and medical\nresearch. They would certainly slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds\nof thousands of jobs. That's why Democrats, Republicans, business\nleaders, and economists have already said that these cuts, known here in\nWashington as \"the sequester,\" are a really bad idea.Now, some in this Congress have proposed preventing only the defense\ncuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job\ntraining; Medicare and Social Security benefits.That idea is even worse. Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt\nis the rising cost of health care for an aging population. And those of\nus who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need\nfor modest reforms -- otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out\nthe investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of\na secure retirement for future generations.But we can't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the\nentire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the\nwealthiest and most powerful. We won't grow the middle class simply by\nshifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are\nalready struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers,\ncops, and firefighters. Most Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and\nIndependents -- understand that we can't just cut our way to prosperity.\nThey know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach\nto deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody\ndoing their fair share. And that's the approach I offer tonight.On Medicare, I'm prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same\namount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the\nreforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission. Already,\nthe Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care\ncosts. The reforms I'm proposing go even further. We'll reduce taxpayer\nsubsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the\nwealthiest seniors. We'll bring down costs by changing the way our\ngovernment pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn't be\nbased on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital --\nthey should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive.\nAnd I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they\ndon't violate the guarantee of a secure retirement. Our government\nshouldn't make promises we cannot keep -- but we must keep the promises\nwe've already made.To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what\nleaders in both parties have already suggested, and save hundreds of\nbillions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for\nthe well-off and well-connected. After all, why would we choose to make\ndeeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest\ntax breaks? How is that fair? How does that promote growth?Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that\nencourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit. The American\npeople deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time\nfilling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring; a tax\ncode that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can't pay a\nlower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a tax code that lowers\nincentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses\nand manufacturers that create jobs right here in America. That's what\ntax reform can deliver. That's what we can do together.I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform won't be easy. The\npolitics will be hard for both sides. None of us will get 100 percent of\nwhat we want. But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy,\nand visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans. So let's set\nparty interests aside, and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless\ncuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future. And let's do\nit without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off\ninvestors. The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its\nbusiness by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next. Let's\nagree, right here, right now, to keep the people's government open, pay\nour bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the\nUnited States of America. The American people have worked too hard, for\ntoo long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials\ncause another.Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of\nour agenda. But let's be clear: deficit reduction alone is not an\neconomic plan. A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs --\nthat must be the North Star that guides our efforts. Every day, we\nshould ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more\njobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills needed to\ndo those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent\nliving?A year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that\nindependent economists said would create more than one million new jobs.\nI thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda, and I urge\nthis Congress to pass the rest. Tonight, I'll lay out additional\nproposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget\nframework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago. Let me repeat --\nnothing I'm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single\ndime. It's not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government\nthat sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and\nmanufacturing.After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added\nabout 500,000 jobs over the past three. Caterpillar is bringing jobs\nback from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. After locating\nplants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced\nplant right here at home. And this year, Apple will start making Macs in\nAmerica again.There are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend. Last\nyear, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in\nYoungstown, Ohio. A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art\nlab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the\npotential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything. There's no\nreason this can't happen in other towns. So tonight, I'm announcing the\nlaunch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will\npartner with the Departments of Defense and Energy to turn regions left\nbehind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs. And I ask\nthis Congress to help create a network of fifteen of these hubs and\nguarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is Made in America.If we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best\nideas. Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to\nour economy. Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock\nthe answers to Alzheimer's; developing drugs to regenerate damaged\norgans; devising new material to make batteries ten times more powerful.\nNow is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and\ninnovation. Now is the time to reach a level of research and development\nnot seen since the height of the Space Race. And today, no area holds\nmore promise than our investments in American energy.After years of talking about it, we are finally poised to control our\nown energy future. We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years.\nWe have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas, and\nthe amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and\nsolar -- with tens of thousands of good, American jobs to show for it. We\nproduce more natural gas than ever before -- and nearly everyone's energy\nbill is lower because of it. And over the last four years, our emissions\nof the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have\nactually fallen.But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to\ncombat climate change. Yes, it's true that no single event makes a\ntrend. But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in\nthe last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods -- all are now\nmore frequent and intense. We can choose to believe that Superstorm\nSandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires\nsome states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can\nchoose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act\nbefore it's too late.The good news is, we can make meaningful progress on this issue while\ndriving strong economic growth. I urge this Congress to pursue a\nbipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John\nMcCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago. But if\nCongress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will. I will\ndirect my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and\nin the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the\nconsequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more\nsustainable sources of energy.Four years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and\nthe jobs that came with it. We've begun to change that. Last year, wind\nenergy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America. So let's\ngenerate even more. Solar energy gets cheaper by the year -- so let's\ndrive costs down even further. As long as countries like China keep\ngoing all-in on clean energy, so must we.In the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and\ngreater energy independence. That's why my Administration will keep\ncutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits. But I also\nwant to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology\nthat helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and water.Indeed, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that\nwe, the public, own together. So tonight, I propose we use some of our\noil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive\nnew research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for\ngood. If a non-partisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and\nadmirals can get behind this idea, then so can we. Let's take their\nadvice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in\ngas prices we've put up with for far too long. I'm also issuing a new\ngoal for America: let's cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and\nbusinesses over the next twenty years. The states with the best ideas to\ncreate jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient\nbuildings will receive federal support to help make it happen.America's energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure\nbadly in need of repair. Ask any CEO where they'd rather locate and\nhire: a country with deteriorating roads and bridges, or one with\nhigh-speed rail and internet; high-tech schools and self-healing power\ngrids. The CEO of Siemens America -- a company that brought hundreds of\nnew jobs to North Carolina -- has said that if we upgrade our\ninfrastructure, they'll bring even more jobs. And I know that you want\nthese job-creating projects in your districts. I've seen you all at the\nribbon-cuttings.Tonight, I propose a \"Fix-It-First\" program to put people to work as\nsoon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000\nstructurally deficient bridges across the country. And to make sure\ntaxpayers don't shoulder the whole burden, I'm also proposing a\nPartnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade\nwhat our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods; modern\npipelines to withstand a storm; modern schools worthy of our children.\nLet's prove that there is no better place to do business than the United\nStates of America. And let's start right away.Part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector.\nToday, our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007.\nHome prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years, home purchases\nare up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding again.But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with\nsolid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected. Too many\nfamilies who have never missed a payment and want to refinance are being\ntold no. That's holding our entire economy back, and we need to fix it.\nRight now, there's a bill in this Congress that would give every\nresponsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by\nrefinancing at today's rates. Democrats and Republicans have supported\nit before. What are we waiting for? Take a vote, and send me that bill.\nRight now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from\nbuying their first home. What's holding us back? Let's streamline the\nprocess, and help our economy grow.These initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, and housing\nwill help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new\njobs. But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with\nthe skills and training to fill those jobs. And that has to start at the\nearliest possible age.Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the\nbetter he or she does down the road. But today, fewer than 3 in 10 four\nyear-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program. Most\nmiddle-class parents can't afford a few hundred bucks a week for private\npreschool. And for poor kids who need help the most, this lack of access\nto preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives.Tonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool\navailable to every child in America. Every dollar we invest in\nhigh-quality early education can save more than seven dollars later on --\nby boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing\nviolent crime. In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest\nchildren, like Georgia or Oklahoma, studies show students grow up more\nlikely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high school, hold a\njob, and form more stable families of their own. So let's do what works,\nand make sure none of our children start the race of life already\nbehind. Let's give our kids that chance.Let's also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path\nto a good job. Right now, countries like Germany focus on graduating\ntheir high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree\nfrom one of our community colleges, so that they're ready for a job. At\nschools like P-Tech in Brooklyn, a collaboration between New York Public\nSchools, the City University of New York, and IBM, students will\ngraduate with a high school diploma and an associate degree in computers\nor engineering.We need to give every American student opportunities like this. Four\nyears ago, we started Race to the Top -- a competition that convinced\nalmost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards,\nfor about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year. Tonight,\nI'm announcing a new challenge to redesign America's high schools so\nthey better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy.\nWe'll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and\nemployers, and create classes that focus on science, technology,\nengineering, and math -- the skills today's employers are looking for to\nfill jobs right now and in the future.Now, even with better high schools, most young people will need some\nhigher education. It's a simple fact: the more education you have, the\nmore likely you are to have a job and work your way into the middle\nclass. But today, skyrocketing costs price way too many young people out\nof a higher education, or saddle them with unsustainable debt.Through tax credits, grants, and better loans, we have made college more\naffordable for millions of students and families over the last few\nyears. But taxpayers cannot continue to subsidize the soaring cost of\nhigher education. Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and\nit's our job to make sure they do. Tonight, I ask Congress to change the\nHigher Education Act, so that affordability and value are included in\ndetermining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid. And\ntomorrow, my Administration will release a new \"College Scorecard\" that\nparents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple\ncriteria: where you can get the most bang for your educational buck.To grow our middle class, our citizens must have access to the education\nand training that today's jobs require. But we also have to make sure\nthat America remains a place where everyone who's willing to work hard\nhas the chance to get ahead.Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of\nstriving, hopeful immigrants. And right now, leaders from the business,\nlabor, law enforcement, and faith communities all agree that the time\nhas come to pass comprehensive immigration reform.Real reform means strong border security, and we can build on the\nprogress my Administration has already made -- putting more boots on the\nsouthern border than at any time in our history, and reducing illegal\ncrossings to their lowest levels in 40 years.Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned\ncitizenship -- a path that includes passing a background check, paying\ntaxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back\nof the line behind the folks trying to come here legally.And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting\nperiods, reduce bureaucracy, and attract the highly-skilled\nentrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our\neconomy.In other words, we know what needs to be done. As we speak, bipartisan\ngroups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I\napplaud their efforts. Now let's get this done. Send me a comprehensive\nimmigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right\naway.But we can't stop there. We know our economy is stronger when our wives,\nmothers, and daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in\nthe workplace, and free from the fear of domestic violence. Today, the\nSenate passed the Violence Against Women Act that Joe Biden originally\nwrote almost 20 years ago. I urge the House to do the same. And I ask\nthis Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their\nefforts, and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year.We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day's work with\nhonest wages. But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage\nearns $14,500 a year. Even with the tax relief we've put in place, a\nfamily with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the\npoverty line. That's wrong. That's why, since the last time this\nCongress raised the minimum wage, nineteen states have chosen to bump\ntheirs even higher.Tonight, let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one\nwho works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the\nfederal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour. This single step would raise the\nincomes of millions of working families. It could mean the difference\nbetween groceries or the food bank; rent or eviction; scraping by or\nfinally getting ahead. For businesses across the country, it would mean\ncustomers with more money in their pockets. In fact, working folks\nshouldn't have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up\nwhile CEO pay has never been higher. So here's an idea that Governor\nRomney and I actually agreed on last year: let's tie the minimum wage to\nthe cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on.Tonight, let's also recognize that there are communities in this country\nwhere no matter how hard you work, it's virtually impossible to get\nahead. Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up.\nInescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are\nstill fighting for their first job. America is not a place where chance\nof birth or circumstance should decide our destiny. And that is why we\nneed to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all\nwho are willing to climb them.Let's offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who've got what\nit takes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so long\nthat no one will give them a chance. Let's put people back to work\nrebuilding vacant homes in run-down neighborhoods. And this year, my\nAdministration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest-hit towns in\nAmerica to get these communities back on their feet. We'll work with\nlocal leaders to target resources at public safety, education, and\nhousing. We'll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest.\nAnd we'll work to strengthen families by removing the financial\ndeterrents to marriage for low-income couples, and doing more to\nencourage fatherhood -- because what makes you a man isn't the ability to\nconceive a child; it's having the courage to raise one.Stronger families. Stronger communities. A stronger America. It is this\nkind of prosperity -- broad, shared, and built on a thriving middle class\n-- that has always been the source of our progress at home. It is also\nthe foundation of our power and influence throughout the world.Tonight, we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who\nsacrifice every day to protect us. Because of them, we can say with\nconfidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan, and\nachieve our objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda. Already, we\nhave brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and women. This spring,\nour forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces\ntake the lead. Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another\n34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan. This drawdown\nwill continue. And by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will\nbe over.Beyond 2014, America's commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan\nwill endure, but the nature of our commitment will change. We are\nnegotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two\nmissions: training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does\nnot again slip into chaos, and counter-terrorism efforts that allow us\nto pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates.Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its\nformer self. Different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have\nemerged -- from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa. The threat these groups\npose is evolving. But to meet this threat, we don't need to send tens of\nthousands of our sons and daughters abroad, or occupy other nations.\nInstead, we will need to help countries like Yemen, Libya, and Somalia\nprovide for their own security, and help allies who take the fight to\nterrorists, as we have in Mali. And, where necessary, through a range of\ncapabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those\nterrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans.As we do, we must enlist our values in the fight. That is why my\nAdministration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy\nframework to guide our counterterrorism operations. Throughout, we have\nkept Congress fully informed of our efforts. I recognize that in our\ndemocracy, no one should just take my word that we're doing things the\nright way. So, in the months ahead, I will continue to engage with\nCongress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention, and\nprosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of\nchecks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to\nthe American people and to the world.Of course, our challenges don't end with al Qaeda. America will continue\nto lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world's most dangerous\nweapons. The regime in North Korea must know that they will only achieve\nsecurity and prosperity by meeting their international obligations.\nProvocations of the sort we saw last night will only isolate them\nfurther, as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense,\nand lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats.Likewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a\ndiplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding that\nthey meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to prevent\nthem from getting a nuclear weapon. At the same time, we will engage\nRussia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals, and continue\nleading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall\ninto the wrong hands -- because our ability to influence others depends\non our willingness to lead.America must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber-attacks. We\nknow hackers steal people's identities and infiltrate private e-mail. We\nknow foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets. Now\nour enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our\nfinancial institutions, and our air traffic control systems. We cannot\nlook back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of\nreal threats to our security and our economy.That's why, earlier today, I signed a new executive order that will\nstrengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing, and\ndeveloping standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our\nprivacy. Now, Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give\nour government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter\nattacks.Even as we protect our people, we should remember that today's world\npresents not only dangers, but opportunities. To boost American exports,\nsupport American jobs, and level the playing field in the growing\nmarkets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific\nPartnership. And tonight, I am announcing that we will launch talks on a\ncomprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the\nEuropean Union -- because trade that is free and fair across the Atlantic\nsupports millions of good-paying American jobs.We also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world\nenriches us all. In many places, people live on little more than a\ndollar a day. So the United States will join with our allies to\neradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades: by connecting\nmore people to the global economy and empowering women; by giving our\nyoung and brightest minds new opportunities to serve and helping\ncommunities to feed, power, and educate themselves; by saving the\nworld's children from preventable deaths; and by realizing the promise\nof an AIDS-free generation.Above all, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during\nthis period of historic change. I saw the power of hope last year in\nRangoon -- when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the\nhome where she had been imprisoned for years; when thousands of Burmese\nlined the streets, waving American flags, including a man who said,\n\"There is justice and law in the United States. I want our country to be\nlike that.\"In defense of freedom, we will remain the anchor of strong alliances\nfrom the Americas to Africa; from Europe to Asia. In the Middle East, we\nwill stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights, and\nsupport stable transitions to democracy. The process will be messy, and\nwe cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like\nEgypt; but we can -- and will -- insist on respect for the fundamental\nrights of all people. We will keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that\nhas murdered its own people, and support opposition leaders that respect\nthe rights of every Syrian. And we will stand steadfast with Israel in\npursuit of security and a lasting peace. These are the messages I will\ndeliver when I travel to the Middle East next month.All this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in\ndangerous places at great personal risk -- our diplomats, our\nintelligence officers, and the men and women of the United States Armed\nForces. As long as I'm Commander-in-Chief, we will do whatever we must\nto protect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain\nthe best military in the world. We will invest in new capabilities, even\nas we reduce waste and wartime spending. We will ensure equal treatment\nfor all service members, and equal benefits for their families -- gay and\nstraight. We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and\ndaughters, because women have proven under fire that they are ready for\ncombat. We will keep faith with our veterans -- investing in world-class\ncare, including mental health care, for our wounded warriors; supporting\nour military families; and giving our veterans the benefits, education,\nand job opportunities they have earned. And I want to thank my wife\nMichelle and Dr. Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving\nour military families as well as they serve us.But defending our freedom is not the job of our military alone. We must\nall do our part to make sure our God-given rights are protected here at\nhome. That includes our most fundamental right as citizens: the right to\nvote. When any Americans -- no matter where they live or what their party\n-- are denied that right simply because they can't wait for five, six,\nseven hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals.\nThat's why, tonight, I'm announcing a non-partisan commission to improve\nthe voting experience in America. And I'm asking two long-time experts\nin the field, who've recently served as the top attorneys for my\ncampaign and for Governor Romney's campaign, to lead it. We can fix\nthis, and we will. The American people demand it. And so does our\ndemocracy.Of course, what I've said tonight matters little if we don't come\ntogether to protect our most precious resource -- our children.It has been two months since Newtown. I know this is not the first time\nthis country has debated how to reduce gun violence. But this time is\ndifferent. Overwhelming majorities of Americans -- Americans who believe\nin the 2nd Amendment -- have come together around commonsense reform --\nlike background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get\ntheir hands on a gun. Senators of both parties are working together on\ntough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to\ncriminals. Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and\nmassive ammunition magazines off our streets, because they are tired of\nbeing outgunned.Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. If you want to vote\nno, that's your choice. But these proposals deserve a vote. Because in\nthe two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays,\ngraduations, and anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a\nbullet from a gun.One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton. She was 15\nyears old. She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss. She was a majorette. She\nwas so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best friend.\nJust three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates,\nperforming for her country at my inauguration. And a week later, she was\nshot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my\nhouse.Hadiya's parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight, along with\nmore than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun\nviolence. They deserve a vote.Gabby Giffords deserves a vote.The families of Newtown deserve a vote.The families of Aurora deserve a vote.The families of Oak Creek, and Tucson, and Blacksburg, and the countless\nother communities ripped open by gun violence -- they deserve a simple\nvote.Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this\ncountry. Indeed, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will\nperfectly solve all the challenges I've outlined tonight. But we were\nnever sent here to be perfect. We were sent here to make what difference\nwe can, to secure this nation, expand opportunity, and uphold our ideals\nthrough the hard, often frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of\nself-government.We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they\nlook out for one another, every single day, usually without fanfare, all\nacross this country. We should follow their example.We should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu\nSanchez. When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, her\nthoughts were not with how her own home was faring -- they were with the\ntwenty precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised\nthat kept them all safe.We should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline\nVictor. When she arrived at her polling place, she was told the wait to\nvote might be six hours. And as time ticked by, her concern was not with\nher tired body or aching feet, but whether folks like her would get to\nhave their say. Hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in line in\nsupport of her. Because Desiline is 102 years old. And they erupted in\ncheers when she finally put on a sticker that read \"I Voted.\"We should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy.\nWhen a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, and Brian was\nthe first to arrive, he did not consider his own safety. He fought back\nuntil help arrived, and ordered his fellow officers to protect the\nsafety of the Americans worshiping inside -- even as he lay bleeding from\ntwelve bullet wounds.When asked how he did that, Brian said, \"That's just the way we're\nmade.\"That's just the way we're made.We may do different jobs, and wear different uniforms, and hold\ndifferent views than the person beside us. But as Americans, we all\nshare the same proud title:We are citizens. It's a word that doesn't just describe our nationality\nor legal status. It describes the way we're made. It describes what we\nbelieve. It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when\nwe accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations;\nthat our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that well\ninto our third century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as\ncitizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great\nchapter in our American story.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",
