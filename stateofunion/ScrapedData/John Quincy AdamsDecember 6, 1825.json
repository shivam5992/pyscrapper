    "speech": "Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:In taking a general survey of the concerns of our beloved country, with\nreference to subjects interesting to the common welfare, the first\nsentiment which impresses itself upon the mind is of gratitude to the\nOmnipotent Disposer of All Good for the continuance of the signal\nblessings of His providence, and especially for that health which to an\nunusual extent has prevailed within our borders, and for that abundance\nwhich in the vicissitudes of the seasons has been scattered with\nprofusion over our land. Nor ought we less to ascribe to Him the glory\nthat we are permitted to enjoy the bounties of His hand in peace and\ntranquillity--in peace with all the other nations of the earth, in\ntranquillity among our selves. There has, indeed, rarely been a period\nin the history of civilized man in which the general condition of the\nChristian nations has been marked so extensively by peace and\nprosperity.Europe, with a few partial and unhappy exceptions, has enjoyed ten\nyears of peace, during which all her Governments, what ever the theory\nof their constitutions may have been, are successively taught to feel\nthat the end of their institution is the happiness of the people, and\nthat the exercise of power among men can be justified only by the\nblessings it confers upon those over whom it is extended.During the same period our intercourse with all those nations has been\npacific and friendly; it so continues. Since the close of your last\nsession no material variation has occurred in our relations with any\none of them. In the commercial and navigation system of Great Britain\nimportant changes of municipal regulation have recently been sanctioned\nby acts of Parliament, the effect of which upon the interests of other\nnations, and particularly upon ours, has not yet been fully developed.\nIn the recent renewal of the diplomatic missions on both sides between\nthe two Governments assurances have been given and received of the\ncontinuance and increase of the mutual confidence and cordiality by\nwhich the adjustment of many points of difference had already been\neffected, and which affords the surest pledge for the ultimate\nsatisfactory adjustment of those which still remain open or may\nhereafter arise.The policy of the United States in their commercial intercourse with\nother nations has always been of the most liberal character. In the\nmutual exchange of their respective productions they have abstained\naltogether from prohibitions; they have interdicted themselves the\npower of laying taxes upon exports, and when ever they have favored\ntheir own shipping by special preferences or exclusive privileges in\ntheir own ports it has been only with a view to countervail similar\nfavors and exclusions granted by the nations with whom we have been\nengaged in traffic to their own people or shipping, and to the\ndisadvantage of ours. Immediately after the close of the last war a\nproposal was fairly made by the act of Congress of March 3rd, 1815, to\nall the maritime nations to lay aside the system of retaliating\nrestrictions and exclusions, and to place the shipping of both parties\nto the common trade on a footing of equality in respect to the duties\nof tonnage and impost. This offer was partially and successively\naccepted by Great Britain, Sweden, the Netherlands, the Hanseatic\ncities, Prussia, Sardinia, the Duke of Oldenburg, and Russia. It was\nalso adopted, under certain modifications, in our late commercial\nconvention with France, and by the act of Congress of January 1st,\n1824, it has received a new confirmation with all the nations who had\nacceded to it, and has been offered again to all those who are or may\nhere after be willing to abide in reciprocity by it. But all these\nregulations, whether established by treaty or by municipal enactments,\nare still subject to one important restriction.The removal of discriminating duties of tonnage and of impost is\nlimited to articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of the\ncountry to which the vessel belongs or to such articles as are most\nusually first shipped from her ports. It will deserve the serious\nconsideration of Congress whether even this remnant of restriction may\nnot be safely abandoned, and whether the general tender of equal\ncompetition made in the act of January 8th, 1824, maynot be extended to\ninclude all articles of merchandise not prohibited, of what country so\never they may be the produce or manufacture. Propositions of this\neffect have already been made to us by more than one European\nGovernment, and it is probable that if once established by legislation\nor compact with any distinguished maritime state it would recommend\nitself by the experience of its advantages to the general accession of\nall.The convention of commerce and navigation between the United States and\nFrance, concluded on June 24th, 1822, was, in the understanding and\nintent of both parties, as appears upon its face, only a temporary\narrangement of the points of difference between them of the most\nimmediate and pressing urgency. It was limited in the first instance to\ntwo years from January 10th, 1822, but with a proviso that it should\nfurther continue in force 'til the conclusion of a general and\ndefinitive treaty of commerce, unless terminated by a notice, six\nmonths in advance, of either of the parties to the other. Its operation\nso far as it extended has been mutually advantageous, and it still\ncontinues in force by common consent. But it left unadjusted several\nobjects of great interest to the citizens and subjects of both\ncountries, and particularly a mass of claims to considerable amount of\ncitizens of the United States upon the Government of France of\nindemnity for property taken or destroyed under circumstances of the\nmost aggravated and outrageous character. In the long period during\nwhich continual and earnest appeals have been made to the equity and\nmagnanimity of France in behalf of these claims their justice has not\nbeen, as it could not be, denied.It was hoped that the accession of a new Sovereign to the throne would\nhave afforded a favorable opportunity for presenting them to the\nconsideration of his Government. They have been presented and urged\nhither to without effect. The repeated and earnest representations of\nour minister at the Court of France remain as yet even without an\nanswer. Were the demands of nations upon the justice of each other\nsusceptible of adjudication by the sentence of an impartial tribunal,\nthose to which I now refer would long since have been settled and\nadequate indemnity would have been obtained.There are large amounts of similar claims upon the Netherlands, Naples,\nand Denmark. For those upon Spain prior to 1819 indemnity was, after\nmany years of patient forbearance, obtained; and those upon Sweden have\nbeen lately compromised by a private settlement, in which the claimants\nthemselves have acquiesced. The Governments of Denmark and of Naples\nhave been recently reminded of those yet existing against them, nor\nwill any of them be forgotten while a hope may be indulged of obtaining\njustice by the means within the constitutional power of the Executive,\nand without resorting to those means of self-redress which, as well as\nthe time, circumstances, and occasion which may require them, are\nwithin the exclusive competency of the Legislature.It is with great satisfaction that I am enabled to bear witness to the\nliberal spirit with which the Republic of Colombia has made\nsatisfaction for well-established claims of a similar character, and\namong the documents now communicated to Congress will be distinguished\na treaty of commerce and navigation with that Republic, the\nratifications of which have been exchanged since the last recess of the\nLegislature. The negotiation of similar treaties with all of the\nindependent South American States has been contemplated and may yet be\naccomplished. The basis of them all, as proposed by the United States,\nhas been laid in two principles--the one of entire and unqualified\nreciprocity, the other the mutual obligation of the parties to place\neach other permanently upon the footing of the most favored nation.\nThese principles are, indeed, indispensable to the effectual\nemancipation of the American hemisphere from the thralldom of\ncolonizing monopolies and exclusions, an event rapidly realizing in the\nprogress of human affairs, and which the resistance still opposed in\ncertain parts of Europe to the acknowledgment of the Southern American\nRepublics as independent States will, it is believed, contribute more\neffectually to accomplish. The time has been, and that not remote, when\nsome of those States might, in their anxious desire to obtain a nominal\nrecognition, have accepted of a nominal independence, clogged with\nburdensome conditions, and exclusive commercial privileges granted to\nthe nation from which they have separated to the disadvantage of all\nothers. They are all now aware that such concessions to any European\nnation would be incompatible with that independence which they have\ndeclared and maintained.Among the measures which have been suggested to them by the new\nrelations with one another, resulting from the recent changes in their\ncondition, is that of assembling at the Isthmus of Panama a congress,\nat which each of them should be represented, to deliberate upon objects\nimportant to the welfare of all. The Republics of Colombia, of Mexico,\nand of Central America have already deputed plenipotentiaries to such a\nmeeting, and they have invited the United States to be also represented\nthere by their ministers. The invitation has been accepted, and\nministers on the part of the United States will be commissioned to\nattend at those deliberations, and to take part in them so far as may\nbe compatible with that neutrality from which it is neither our\nintention nor the desire of the other American States that we should\ndepart.The commissioners under the 7th article of the treaty of Ghent have so\nnearly completed their arduous labors that, by the report recently\nreceived from the agent on the part of the United States, there is\nreason to expect that the commission will be closed at their next\nsession, appointed for May 22 of the ensuing year.The other commission, appointed to ascertain the indemnities due for\nslaves carried away from the United States after the close of the late\nwar, have met with some difficulty, which has delayed their progress in\nthe inquiry. A reference has been made to the British Government on the\nsubject, which, it may be hoped, will tend to hasten the decision of\nthe commissioners, or serve as a substitute for it.Among the powers specifically granted to Congress by the Constitution\nare those of establishing uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies\nthroughout the United States and of providing for organizing, arming,\nand disciplining the militia and for governing such part of them as may\nbe employed in the services of the United States. The magnitude and\ncomplexity of the interests affected by legislation upon these subjects\nmay account for the fact that, long and often as both of them have\noccupied the attention and animated the debates of Congress, no systems\nhave yet been devised for fulfilling to the satisfaction of the\ncommunity the duties prescribed by these grants of power.To conciliate the claim of the individual citizen to the enjoyment of\npersonal liberty, with the effective obligation of private contracts,\nis the difficult problem to be solved by a law of bankruptcy. These are\nobjects of the deepest interest to society, affecting all that is\nprecious in the existence of multitudes of persons, many of them in the\nclasses essentially dependent and helpless, of the age requiring\nnurture, and of the sex entitled to protection from the free agency of\nthe parent and the husband. The organization of the militia is yet more\nindispensable to the liberties of the country. It is only by an\neffective militia that we can at once enjoy the repose of peace and bid\ndefiance to foreign aggression; it is by the militia that we are\nconstituted an armed nation, standing in perpetual panoply of defense\nin the presence of all the other nations of the earth. To this end it\nwould be necessary, if possible, so to shape its organization as to\ngive it a more united and active energy. There are laws establishing an\nuniform militia throughout the United States and for arming and\nequipping its whole body. But it is a body of dislocated members,\nwithout the vigor of unity and having little of uniformity but the\nname. To infuse into this most important institution the power of which\nit is susceptible and to make it available for the defense of the Union\nat the shortest notice and at the smallest expense possible of time, of\nlife, and of treasure are among the benefits to be expected from the\npersevering deliberations of Congress.Among the unequivocal indications of our national prosperity is the\nflourishing state of our finances. The revenues of the present year,\nfrom all their principal sources, will exceed the anticipations of the\nlast. The balance in the Treasury on the first of January last was a\nlittle short of $2,000,000, exclusive of $2,500,000, being the moiety\nof the loan of $5,000,000 authorized by the act of May 26th, 1824. The\nreceipts into the Treasury from the first of January to the 30th of\nSeptember, exclusive of the other moiety of the same loan, are\nestimated at $16,500,000, and it is expected that those of the current\nquarter will exceed $5,000,000, forming an aggregate of receipts of\nnearly $22,000,000, independent of the loan. The expenditures of the\nyear will not exceed that sum more than $2,000,000. By those\nexpenditures nearly $8,000,000 of the principal of the public debt that\nhave been discharged.More than $1,500,000 has been devoted to the debt of gratitude to the\nwarriors of the Revolution; a nearly equal sum to the construction of\nfortifications and the acquisition of ordnance and other permanent\npreparations of national defense; $500,000 to the gradual increase of\nthe Navy; an equal sum for purchases of territory from the Indians and\npayment of annuities to them; and upward of $1,000,000 for objects of\ninternal improvement authorized by special acts of the last Congress.\nIf we add to these $4,000,000 for payment of interest upon the public\ndebt, there remains a sum of $7,000,000, which have defrayed the whole\nexpense of the administration of Government in its legislative,\nexecutive, and judiciary departments, including the support of the\nmilitary and naval establishments and all the occasional contingencies\nof a government coextensive with the Union.The amount of duties secured on merchandise imported since the\ncommencement of the year is about $25,500,000, and that which will\naccrue during the current quarter is estimated at $5,500,000; from\nthese $31,000,000, deducting the draw-backs, estimated at less than\n$7,000,000, a sum exceeding $24,000,000 will constitute the revenue of\nthe year, and will exceed the whole expenditures of the year. The\nentire amount of the public debt remaining due on the first of January\nnext will be short of $81,000,000.By an act of Congress of the 3d of March last a loan of $12,000,000 was\nauthorized at 4.5%, or an exchange of stock to that amount of 4.5% for\na stock of 6%, to create a fund for extinguishing an equal amount of\nthe public debt, bearing an interest of 6%, redeemable in 1826. An\naccount of the measures taken to give effect to this act will be laid\nbefore you by the Secretary of the Treasury. As the object which it had\nin view has been but partially accomplished, it will be for the\nconsideration of Congress whether the power with which it clothed the\nExecutive should not be renewed at an early day of the present session,\nand under what modifications.The act of Congress of the 3d of March last, directing the Secretary of\nthe Treasury to subscribe, in the name and for the use of the United\nStates, for 1,500 shares of the capital stock of the Chesapeake and\nDelaware Canal Company, has been executed by the actual subscription\nfor the amount specified; and such other measures have been adopted by\nthat officer, under the act, as the fulfillment of its intentions\nrequires. The latest accounts received of this important undertaking\nauthorize the belief that it is in successful progress.The payments into the Treasury from the proceeds of the sales of the\npublic lands during the present year were estimated at $1,000,000. The\nactual receipts of the first two quarters have fallen very little short\nof that sum; it is not expected that the second half of the year will\nbe equally productive, but the income of the year from that source may\nnow be safely estimated at $1,500,000. The act of Congress of May 18th,\n1824, to provide for the extinguishment of the debt due to the United\nStates by the purchasers of public lands, was limited in its operation\nof relief to the purchaser to the 10th of April last. Its effect at the\nend of the quarter during which it expired was to reduce that debt from\n$10,000,000 to $7,000,000 By the operation of similar prior laws of\nrelief, from and since that of March 2d, 1821, the debt had been\nreduced from upward of $22,000,000 to $10,000,000.It is exceedingly desirable that it should be extinguished altogether;\nand to facilitate that consummation I recommend to Congress the revival\nfor one year more of the act of May 18th, 1824, with such provisional\nmodification as may be necessary to guard the public interests against\nfraudulent practices in the resale of the relinquished land.The purchasers of public lands are among the most useful of our fellow\ncitizens, and since the system of sales for cash alone has been\nintroduced great indulgence has been justly extended to those who had\npreviously purchased upon credit. The debt which had been contracted\nunder the credit sales had become unwieldy, and its extinction was\nalike advantageous to the purchaser and to the public. Under the system\nof sales, matured as it has been by experience, and adapted to the\nexigencies of the times, the lands will continue as they have become,\nan abundant source of revenue; and when the pledge of them to the\npublic creditor shall have been redeemed by the entire discharge of the\nnational debt, the swelling tide of wealth with which they replenish\nthe common Treasury may be made to reflow in unfailing streams of\nimprovement from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.The condition of the various branches of the public service resorting\nfrom the Department of War, and their administration during the current\nyear, will be exhibited in the report of the Secretary of War and the\naccompanying documents herewith communicated. The organization and\ndiscipline of the Army are effective and satisfactory. To counteract\nthe prevalence of desertion among the troops it has been suggested to\nwithhold from the men a small portion of their monthly pay until the\nperiod of their discharge; and some expedient appears to be necessary\nto preserve and maintain among the officers so much of the art of\nhorsemanship as could scarcely fail to be found wanting on the possible\nsudden eruption of a war, which should take us unprovided with a single\ncorps of cavalry.The Military Academy at West Point, under the restrictions of a severe\nbut paternal superintendence, recommends itself more and more to the\npatronage of the nation, and the numbers of meritorious officers which\nit forms and introduces to the public service furnishes the means of\nmultiplying the undertakings of the public improvements to which their\nacquirements at that institution are peculiarly adapted. The school of\nartillery practice established at Fortress Monroe Hampton, Virginia is\nwell suited to the same purpose, and may need the aid of further\nlegislative provision to the same end. The reports of the various\nofficers at the head of the administrative branches of the military\nservice, connected with the quartering, clothing, subsistence, health,\nand pay of the Army, exhibit the assiduous vigilance of those officers\nin the performance of their respective duties, and the faithful\naccountability which has pervaded every part of the system.Our relations with the numerous tribes of aboriginal natives of this\ncountry, scattered over its extensive surface and so dependent even for\ntheir existence upon our power, have been during the present year\nhighly interesting. An act of Congress of May 25th, 1824, made an\nappropriation to defray the expenses of making treaties of trade and\nfriendship with the Indian tribes beyond the Mississippi. An act of\nMarch 3d, 1825, authorized treaties to be made with the Indians for\ntheir consent to the making of a road from the frontier of Missouri to\nthat of New Mexico, and another act of the same date provided for\ndefraying the expenses of holding treaties with the Sioux, Chippeways,\nMenomenees, Sauks, Foxes, etc., for the purpose of establishing\nboundaries and promoting peace between said tribes.The first and last objects of these acts have been accomplished, and\nthe second is yet in a process of execution. The treaties which since\nthe last session of Congress have been concluded with the several\ntribes will be laid before the Senate for their consideration\nconformably to the Constitution. They comprise large and valuable\nacquisitions of territory, and they secure an adjustment of boundaries\nand give pledges of permanent peace between several tribes which had\nbeen long waging bloody wars against each other.On the 12th of February last a treaty was signed at the Indian Springs\nbetween commissioners appointed on the part of the United States and\ncertain chiefs and individuals of the Creek Nation of Indians, which\nwas received at the seat of Government only a very few days before the\nclose of the last session of Congress and of the late Administration.\nThe advice and consent of the Senate was given to it on the 3d of\nMarch, too late for it to receive the ratification of the then\nPresident of the United States; it was ratified on the 7th of March,\nunder the unsuspecting impression that it had been negotiated in good\nfaith and in the confidence inspired by the recommendation of the\nSenate. The subsequent transactions in relation to this treaty will\nform the subject of a separate communication.The appropriations made by Congress for public works, as well in the\nconstruction of fortifications as for purposes of internal improvement,\nso far as they have been expended, have been faithfully applied. Their\nprogress has been delayed by the want of suitable officers for\nsuperintending them. An increase of both the corps of engineers,\nmilitary and topographical, was recommended by my predecessor at the\nlast session of Congress. The reasons upon which that recommendation\nwas founded subsist in all their force and have acquired additional\nurgency since that time. The Military Academy at West Point will\nfurnish from the cadets there officers well qualified for carrying this\nmeasure into effect.The Board of Engineers for Internal Improvement, appointed for carrying\ninto execution the act of Congress of April 30th, 1824, \"to procure the\nnecessary surveys, plans, and estimates on the subject of roads and\ncanals\", have been actively engaged in that service from the close of\nthe last session of Congress. They have completed the surveys necessary\nfor ascertaining the practicability of a canal from the Chesapeake Bay\nto the Ohio River, and are preparing a full report on that subject,\nwhich, when completed, will be laid before you. The same observation is\nto be made with regard to the two other objects of national importance\nupon which the Board have been occupied, namely, the accomplishment of\na national road from this city to New Orleans, and the practicability\nof uniting the waters of Lake Memphramagog with Connecticut River and\nthe improvement of the navigation of that river. The surveys have been\nmade and are nearly completed. The report may be expected at an early\nperiod during the present session of Congress.The acts of Congress of the last session relative to the surveying,\nmarking, or laying out roads in the Territories of Florida, Arkansas,\nand Michigan, from Missouri to Mexico, and for the continuation of the\nCumberland road, are, some of them, fully executed, and others in the\nprocess of execution. Those for completing or commencing fortifications\nhave been delayed only so far as the Corps of Engineers has been\ninadequate to furnish officers for the necessary superintendence of the\nworks. Under the act confirming the statutes of Virginia and Maryland\nincorporating the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, three\ncommissioners on the part of the United States have been appointed for\nopening books and receiving subscriptions, in concert with a like\nnumber of commissioners appointed on the part of each of those States.\nA meeting of the commissioners has been postponed, to await the\ndefinitive report of the board of engineers.The light-houses and monuments for the safety of our commerce and\nmariners, the works for the security of Plymouth Beach and for the\npreservation of the islands in Boston Harbor, have received the\nattention required by the laws relating to those objects respectively.\nThe continuation of the Cumberland road, the most important of them\nall, after surmounting no inconsiderable difficulty in fixing upon the\ndirection of the road, has commenced under the most promising of\nauspices, with the improvements of recent invention in the mode of\nconstruction, and with advantage of a great reduction in the\ncomparative cost of the work.The operation of the laws relating to the Revolutionary pensioners may\ndeserve the renewed consideration of Congress. The act of March 18th,\n1818, while it made provision for many meritorious and indigent\ncitizens who had served in the War of Independence, opened a door to\nnumerous abuses and impositions. To remedy this the act of May 1st, 1820,\nexacted proofs of absolute indigence, which many really in want were\nunable and all susceptible of that delicacy which is allied to many\nvirtues must be deeply reluctant to give. The result has been that some\namong the least deserving have been retained, and some in whom the\nrequisites both of worth and want were combined have been stricken from\nthe list. As the numbers of these venerable relics of an age gone by\ndiminish; as the decays of body, mind, and estate of those that survive\nmust in the common course of nature increase, should not a more liberal\nportion of indulgence be dealt out to them? May not the want in most\ninstances be inferred from the demand when the service can be proved,\nand may not the last days of human infirmity be spared the\nmortification of purchasing a pittance of relief only by the exposure\nof its own necessities? I submit to Congress the expediency of\nproviding for individual cases of this description by special\nenactment, or of revising the act of May 1st, 1820, with a view to\nmitigate the rigor of its exclusions in favor of persons to whom\ncharity now bestowed can scarcely discharge the debt of justice.The portion of the naval force of the Union in actual service has been\nchiefly employed on three stations--the Mediterranean, the coasts of\nSouth America bordering on the Pacific Ocean, and the West Indies. An\noccasional cruiser has been sent to range along the African shores most\npolluted by the traffic of slaves; one armed vessel has been stationed\non the coast of our eastern boundary, to cruise along the fishing\ngrounds in Hudsons Bay and on the coast of Labrador, and the first\nservice of a new frigate has been performed in restoring to his native\nsoil and domestic enjoyments the veteran hero whose youthful blood and\ntreasure had freely flowed in the cause of our country's independence,\nand whose whole life has been a series of services and sacrifices to\nthe improvement of his fellow men.The visit of General Lafayette, alike honorable to himself and to our\ncountry, closed, as it had commenced, with the most affecting\ntestimonials of devoted attachment on his part, and of unbounded\ngratitude of this people to him in return. It will form here-after a\npleasing incident in the annals of our Union, giving to real history\nthe intense interest of romance and signally marking the unpurchasable\ntribute of a great nation's social affections to the disinterested\nchampion of the liberties of human-kind.The constant maintenance of a small squadron in the Mediterranean is a\nnecessary substitute for the humiliating alternative of paying tribute\nfor the security of our commerce in that sea, and for a precarious\npeace, at the mercy of every caprice of four Barbary States, by whom it\nwas liable to be violated. An additional motive for keeping a\nrespectable force stationed there at this time is found in the maritime\nwar raging between the Greeks and the Turks, and in which the neutral\nnavigation of this Union is always in danger of outrage and\ndepredation. A few instances have occurred of such depredations upon\nour merchant vessels by privateers or pirates wearing the Grecian flag,\nbut without real authority from the Greek or any other Government. The\nheroic struggles of the Greeks themselves, in which our warmest\nsympathies as free men and Christians have been engaged, have continued\nto be maintained with vicissitudes of success adverse and favorable.Similar motives have rendered expedient the keeping of a like force on\nthe coasts of Peru and Chile on the Pacific. The irregular and\nconvulsive character of the war upon the shores has been extended to\nthe conflicts upon the ocean. An active warfare has been kept up for\nyears with alternate success, though generally to the advantage of the\nAmerican patriots. But their naval forces have not always been under\nthe control of their own Governments. Blockades, unjustifiable upon any\nacknowledged principles of international law, have been proclaimed by\nofficers in command, and though disavowed by the supreme authorities,\nthe protection of our own commerce against them has been made cause of\ncomplaint and erroneous imputations against some of the most gallant\nofficers of our Navy. Complaints equally groundless have been made by\nthe commanders of the Spanish royal forces in those seas; but the most\neffective protection to our commerce has been the flag and the firmness\nof our own commanding officers.The cessation of the war by the complete triumph of the patriot cause\nhas removed, it is hoped, all cause of dissension with one party and\nall vestige of force of the other. But an unsettled coast of many\ndegrees of latitude forming a part of our own territory and a\nflourishing commerce and fishery extending to the islands of the\nPacific and to China still require that the protecting power of the\nUnion should be displayed under its flag as well upon the ocean as upon\nthe land.The objects of the West India Squadron have been to carry into\nexecution the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade; for\nthe protection of our commerce against vessels of piratical character,\nthough bearing commissions from either of the belligerent parties; for\nits protection against open and unequivocal pirates. These objects\nduring the present year have been accomplished more effectually than at\nany former period. The African slave trade has long been excluded from\nthe use of our flag, and if some few citizens of our country have\ncontinued to set the laws of the Union as well as those of nature and\nhumanity at defiance by persevering in that abominable traffic, it has\nbeen only by sheltering themselves under the banners of other nations\nless earnest for the total extinction of the trade of ours.The active, persevering, and unremitted energy of Captain Warrington\nand of the officers and men under his command on that trying and\nperilous service have been crowned with signal success, and are\nentitled to the approbation of their country. But experience has shown\nthat not even a temporary suspension or relaxation from assiduity can\nbe indulged on that station without reproducing piracy and murder in\nall their horrors; nor is it probably that for years to come our\nimmensely valuable commerce in those seas can navigate in security\nwithout the steady continuance of an armed force devoted to its\nprotection.It were, indeed, a vain and dangerous illusion to believe that in the\npresent or probable condition of human society a commerce so extensive\nand so rich as ours could exist and be pursued in safety without the\ncontinual support of a military marine--the only arm by which the power\nof this Confederacy can be estimated or felt by foreign nations, and\nthe only standing military force which can never be dangerous to our\nown liberties at home. A permanent naval peace establishment,\ntherefore, adapted to our present condition, and adaptable to that\ngigantic growth with which the nation is advancing in its career, is\namong the subjects which have already occupied the foresight of the\nlast Congress, and which will deserve your serious deliberations. Our\nNavy, commenced at an early period of our present political\norganization upon a scale commensurate with the incipient energies, the\nscanty resources, and the comparative indigence of our infancy, was\neven then found adequate to cope with all the powers of Barbary, save\nthe first, and with one of the principle maritime powers of Europe.At a period of further advancement, but with little accession of\nstrength, it not only sustained with honor the most unequal of\nconflicts, but covered itself and our country with unfading glory. But\nit is only since the close of the late war that by the numbers and\nforce of the ships of which it was composed it could deserve the name\nof a navy. Yet it retains nearly the same organization as when it\nconsisted only of five frigates. The rules and regulations by which it\nis governed earnestly call for revision, and the want of a naval school\nof instruction, corresponding with the Military Academy at West Point,\nfor the formation of scientific and accomplished officers, is felt with\ndaily increasing aggravation.The act of Congress of May 26th, 1824, authorizing an examination and\nsurvey of the harbor of Charleston, in South Carolina, of St. Marys, in\nGeorgia, and of the coast of Florida, and for other purposes, has been\nexecuted so far as the appropriation would admit. Those of the 3d of\nMarch last, authorizing the establishment of a navy yard and depot on\nthe coast of Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico, and authorizing the\nbuilding of ten sloops of war, and for other purposes, are in the\ncourse of execution, for the particulars of which and other objects\nconnected with this Department I refer to the report of the Secretary\nof the Navy, herewith communicated.A report from the Post Master General is also submitted, exhibiting the\npresent flourishing condition of that Department. For the first time\nfor many years the receipts for the year ending on the first of July\nlast exceeded the expenditures during the same period to the amount of\nmore than $45,000. Other facts equally creditable to the administration\nof this Department are that in two years from July 1st, 1823, an\nimprovement of more than $185,000 in its pecuniary affairs has been\nrealized; that in the same interval the increase of the transportation\nof the mail has exceeded 1,500,000 miles annually, and that 1,040 new\npost offices have been established. It hence appears that under\njudicious management the income from this establishment may be relied\non as fully adequate to defray its expenses, and that by the\ndiscontinuance of post roads altogether unproductive, others of more\nuseful character may be opened, 'til the circulation of the mail shall\nkeep pace with the spread of our population, and the comforts of\nfriendly correspondence, the exchanges of internal traffic, and the\nlights of the periodical press shall be distributed to the remotest\ncorners of the Union, at a charge scarcely perceptible to any\nindividual, and without the cost of a dollar to the public Treasury.Upon this first occasion of addressing the Legislature of the Union,\nwith which I have been honored, in presenting to their view the\nexecution so far as it has been effected of the measures sanctioned by\nthem for promoting the internal improvement of our country, I can not\nclose the communication without recommending to their calm and\npersevering consideration the general principle in a more enlarged\nextent. The great object of the institution of civil government is the\nimprovement of the condition of those who are parties to the social\ncompact, and no government, in what ever form constituted, can\naccomplish the lawful ends of its institution but in proportion as it\nimproves the condition of those over whom it is established. Roads and\ncanals, by multiplying and facilitating the communications and\nintercourse between distant regions and multitudes of men, are among\nthe most important means of improvement. But moral, political,\nintellectual improvement are duties assigned by the Author of Our\nExistence to social no less than to individual man.For the fulfillment of those duties governments are invested with\npower, and to the attainment of the end--the progressive improvement of\nthe condition of the governed--the exercise of delegated powers is a\nduty as sacred and indispensable as the usurpation of powers not\ngranted is criminal and odious.Among the first, perhaps the very first, instrument for the improvement\nof the condition of men is knowledge, and to the acquisition of much of\nthe knowledge adapted to the wants, the comforts, and enjoyments of\nhuman life public institutions and seminaries of learning are\nessential. So convinced of this was the first of my predecessors in\nthis office, now first in the memory, as, living, he was first in the\nhearts, of our country-men, that once and again in his addresses to the\nCongresses with whom he cooperated in the public service he earnestly\nrecommended the establishment of seminaries of learning, to prepare for\nall the emergencies of peace and war--a national university and a\nmilitary academy. With respect to the latter, had he lived to the\npresent day, in turning his eyes to the institution at West Point he\nwould have enjoyed the gratification of his most earnest wishes; but in\nsurveying the city which has been honored with his name he would have\nseen the spot of earth which he had destined and bequeathed to the use\nand benefit of his country as the site for a university still bare and\nbarren.In assuming her station among the civilized nations of the earth it\nwould seem that our country had contracted the engagement to contribute\nher share of mind, of labor, and of expense to the improvement of those\nparts of knowledge which lie beyond the reach of individual\nacquisition, and particularly to geographical and astronomical science.\nLooking back to the history only of the half century since the\ndeclaration of our independence, and observing the generous emulation\nwith which the Governments of France, Great Britain, and Russia have\ndevoted the genius, the intelligence, the treasures of their respective\nnations to the common improvement of the species in these branches of\nscience, is it not incumbent upon us to inquire whether we are not\nbound by obligations of a high and honorable character to contribute\nour portion of energy and exertion to the common stock? The voyages of\ndiscovery prosecuted in the course of that time at the expense of those\nnations have not only redounded to their glory, but to the improvement\nof human knowledge.We have been partakers of that improvement and owe for it a sacred\ndebt, not only of gratitude, but of equal or proportional exertion in\nthe same common cause. Of the cost of these undertakings, if the mere\nexpenditures of outfit, equipment, and completion of the expeditions\nwere to be considered the only charges, it would be unworthy of a great\nand generous nation to take a second thought. One hundred expeditions\nof circumnavigation like those of Cook and La Prouse would not burden\nthe exchequer of the nation fitting them out so much as the ways and\nmeans of defraying a single campaign in war. But if we take into\naccount the lives of those benefactors of man-kind of which their\nservices in the cause of their species were the purchase, how shall the\ncost of those heroic enterprises be estimated, and what compensation\ncan be made to them or to their countries for them? Is it not by\nbearing them in affectionate remembrance? Is it not still more by\nimitating their example--by enabling country-men of our own to pursue\nthe same career and to hazard their lives in the same cause?In inviting the attention of Congress to the subject of internal\nimprovements upon a view thus enlarged it is not my desire to recommend\nthe equipment of an expedition for circumnavigating the globe for\npurposes of scientific research and inquiry. We have objects of useful\ninvestigation nearer home, and to which our cares may be more\nbeneficially applied. The interior of our own territories has yet been\nvery imperfectly explored. Our coasts along many degrees of latitude\nupon the shores of the Pacific Ocean, though much frequented by our\nspirited commercial navigators, have been barely visited by our public\nships. The River of the West, first fully discovered and navigated by a\ncountry-man of our own, still bears the name of the ship in which he\nascended its waters, and claims the protection of our armed national\nflag at its mouth. With the establishment of a military post there or\nat some other point of that coast, recommended by my predecessor and\nalready matured in the deliberations of the last Congress, I would\nsuggest the expediency of connecting the equipment of a public ship for\nthe exploration of the whole north-west coast of this continent.The establishment of an uniform standard of weights and measures was\none of the specific objects contemplated in the formation of our\nConstitution, and to fix that standard was on of the powers delegated\nby express terms in that instrument to Congress. The Governments of\nGreat Britain and France have scarcely ceased to be occupied with\ninquiries and speculations on the same subject since the existence of\nour Constitution, and with them it has expanded into profound,\nlaborious, and expensive researches into the figure of the earth and\nthe comparative length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in various\nlatitudes from the equator to the pole. These researches have resulted\nin the composition and publication of several works highly interesting\nto the cause of science. The experiments are yet in the process of\nperformance. Some of them have recently been made on our own shores,\nwithin the walls of one of our own colleges, and partly by one of our\nown fellow citizens. It would be honorable to our country if the sequel\nof the same experiments should be countenanced by the patronage of our\nGovernment, as they have hitherto been by those of France and Britain.Connected with the establishment of an university, or separate from it,\nmight be undertaken the erection of an astronomical observatory, with\nprovision for the support of an astronomer, to be in constant\nattendance of observation upon the phenomena of the heavens, and for\nthe periodical publication of his observances. It is with no feeling of\npride as an American that the remark may be made that on the\ncomparatively small territorial surface of Europe there are existing\nupward of 130 of these light-houses of the skies, while throughout the\nwhole American hemisphere there is not one. If we reflect a moment upon\nthe discoveries which in the last four centuries have been made in the\nphysical constitution of the universe by the means of these buildings\nand of observers stationed in them, shall we doubt of their usefulness\nto every nation? And while scarcely a year passes over our heads\nwithout bringing some new astronomical discovery to light, which we\nmust fain receive at second hand from Europe, are we not cutting\nourselves off from the means of returning light for light while we have\nneither observatory nor observer upon our half of the globe and the\nearth revolves in perpetual darkness to our unsearching eyes?When, on October 25th, 1791, the first President of the United States\nannounced to Congress the result of the first enumeration of the\ninhabitants of this Union, he informed them that the returns gave the\npleasing assurance that the population of the United States bordered on\n4,000,000 persons. At the distance of 30 years from that time the last\nenumeration, five years since completed, presented a population\nbordering on 10,000,000. Perhaps of all the evidence of a prosperous\nand happy condition of human society the rapidity of the increase of\npopulation is the most unequivocal. But the demonstration of our\nprosperity rests not alone upon this indication.Our commerce, our wealth, and the extent of our territories have\nincreased in corresponding proportions, and the number of independent\ncommunities associated in our Federal Union has since that time nearly\ndoubled. The legislative representation of the States and people in the\ntwo Houses of Congress has grown with the growth of their constituent\nbodies. The House, which then consisted of 65 members, now numbers\nupward of 200. The Senate, which consisted of 26 members, has now 48.\nBut the executive and, still more, the judiciary departments are yet in\na great measure confined to their primitive organization, and are now\nnot adequate to the urgent wants of a still growing community.The naval armaments, which at an early period forced themselves upon\nthe necessities of the Union, soon led to the establishment of a\nDepartment of the Navy. But the Departments of Foreign Affairs and of\nthe Interior, which early after the formation of the Government had\nbeen united in one, continue so united to this time, to the\nunquestionable detriment of the public service. The multiplication of\nour relations with the nations and Governments of the Old World has\nkept pace with that of our population and commerce, while within the\nlast ten years a new family of nations in our own hemisphere has arisen\namong the inhabitants of the earth, with whom our intercourse,\ncommercial and political, would of itself furnish occupation to an\nactive and industrious department.The constitution of the judiciary, experimental and imperfect as it was\neven in the infancy of our existing Government, is yet more inadequate\nto the administration of national justice at our present maturity. Nine\nyears have elapsed since a predecessor in this office, now not the\nlast, the citizen who, perhaps, of all others throughout the Union\ncontributed most to the formation and establishment of our\nConstitution, in his valedictory address to Congress, immediately\npreceding his retirement from public life, urgently recommended the\nrevision of the judiciary and the establishment of an additional\nexecutive department. The exigencies of the public service and its\nunavoidable deficiencies, as now in exercise, have added yearly\ncumulative weight to the considerations presented by him as persuasive\nto the measure, and in recommending it to your deliberations I am happy\nto have the influence of this high authority in aid of the undoubting\nconvictions of my own experience.The laws relating to the administration of the Patent Office are\ndeserving of much consideration and perhaps susceptible of some\nimprovement. The grant of power to regulate the action of Congress upon\nthis subject has specified both the end to be obtained and the means by\nwhich it is to be effected, \"to promote the progress of science and\nuseful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the\nexclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries\". If an\nhonest pride might be indulged in the reflection that on the records of\nthat office are already found inventions the usefulness of which has\nscarcely been transcended in the annals of human ingenuity, would not\nits exultation be allayed by the inquiry whether the laws have\neffectively insured to the inventors the reward destined to them by the\nConstitution--even a limited term of exclusive right to their\ndiscoveries?On December 24th, 1799, it was resolved by Congress that a marble\nmonument should be erected by the United States in the Capitol at the\ncity of Washington; that the family of General Washington should be\nrequested to permit his body to be deposited under it, and that the\nmonument be so designed as to commemorate the great events of his\nmilitary and political life. In reminding Congress of this resolution\nand that the monument contemplated by it remains yet without execution,\nI shall indulge only the remarks that the works at the Capitol are\napproaching to completion; that the consent of the family, desired by\nthe resolution, was requested and obtained; that a monument has been\nrecently erected in this city over the remains of another distinguished\npatriot of the Revolution, and that a spot has been reserved within the\nwalls where you are deliberating for the benefit of this and future\nages, in which the mortal remains may be deposited of him whose spirit\nhovers over you and listens with delight to every act of the\nrepresentatives of his nation which can tend to exalt and adorn his and\ntheir country.The Constitution under which you are assembled is a charter of limited\npowers. After full and solemn deliberation upon all or any of the\nobjects which, urged by an irresistible sense of my own duty, I have\nrecommended to your attention should you come to the conclusion that,\nhowever desirable in themselves, the enactment of laws for effecting\nthem would transcend the powers committed to you by that venerable\ninstrument which we are all bound to support, let no consideration\ninduce you to assume the exercise of powers not granted to you by the\npeople.But if the power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases what so\never over the District of Columbia; if the power to lay and collect\ntaxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts and provide for\nthe common defense and general welfare of the United States; if the\npower to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several\nStates and with the Indian tribes, to fix the standard of weights and\nmeasures, to establish post offices and post roads, to declare war, to\nraise and support armies, to provide and maintain a navy, to dispose of\nand make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or\nother property belonging to the United States, and to make all laws\nwhich shall be necessary and proper for carrying these powers into\nexecution--if these powers and others enumerated in the Constitution\nmay be effectually brought into action by laws promoting the\nimprovement of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, the cultivation\nand encouragement of the mechanic and of the elegant arts, the\nadvancement of literature, and the progress of the sciences, ornamental\nand profound, to refrain from exercising them for the benefit of the\npeople themselves would be to hide in the earth the talent committed to\nour charge--would be treachery to the most sacred of trusts.The spirit of improvement is abroad upon the earth. It stimulates the\nhearts and sharpens the faculties not of our fellow citizens alone, but\nof the nations of Europe and of their rulers. While dwelling with\npleasing satisfaction upon the superior excellence of our political\ninstitutions, let us not be unmindful that liberty is power; that the\nnation blessed with the largest portion of liberty must in proportion\nto its numbers be the most powerful nation upon earth, and that the\ntenure of power by man is, in the moral purposes of his Creator, upon\ncondition that it shall be exercised to ends of beneficence, to improve\nthe condition of himself and his fellow men.While foreign nations less blessed with that freedom which is power\nthan ourselves are advancing with gigantic strides in the career of\npublic improvement, were we to slumber in indolence or fold up our arms\nand proclaim to the world that we are palsied by the will of our\nconstituents, would it not be to cast away the bounties of Providence\nand doom ourselves to perpetual inferiority? In the course of the year\nnow drawing to its close we have beheld, under the auspices and at the\nexpense of one State of this Union, a new university unfolding its\nportals to the sons of science and holding up the torch of human\nimprovement to eyes that seek the light. We have seen under the\npersevering and enlightened enterprise of another State the waters of\nour Western lakes mingle with those of the ocean. If undertakings like\nthese have been accomplished in the compass of a few years by the\nauthority of single members of our Confederation, can we, the\nrepresentative authorities of the whole Union, fall behind our fellow\nservants in the exercise of the trust committed to us for the benefit\nof our common sovereign by the accomplishment of works important to the\nwhole and to which neither the authority nor the resources of any one\nState can be adequate?Finally, fellow citizens, I shall await with cheering hope and faithful\ncooperation the result of your deliberations, assured that, without\nencroaching upon the powers reserved to the authorities of the\nrespective States or to the people, you will, with a due sense of your\nobligations to your country and of the high responsibilities weighing\nupon yourselves, give efficacy to the means committed to you for the\ncommon good. And may He who searches the hearts of the children of men\nprosper your exertions to secure the blessings of peace and promote the\nhighest welfare of your country.JOHN QUINCY ADAMS",
