    "speech": "Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished citizens\nand fellow citizens: Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider\nthe state of the Union. This year, we gather in this Chamber deeply aware of\ndecisive days that lie ahead.You and I serve our country in a time of great consequence. During this session\nof Congress, we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital to our country.\nWe have the opportunity to save millions of lives abroad from a terrible\ndisease. We will work for a prosperity that is broadly shared, and we will\nanswer every danger and every enemy that threatens the American people.In all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can be confident. In a\nwhirlwind of change and hope and peril, our faith is sure; our resolve is firm;\nand our Union is strong.This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will\nnot pass along our problems to other Congresses, to other Presidents, and other\ngenerations. We will confront them with focus and clarity and courage.During the last 2 years, we have seen what can be accomplished when we work\ntogether. To lift the standards of our public schools, we achieved historic\neducation reform, which must now be carried out in every school and in every\nclassroom so that every child in America can read and learn and succeed in life.\nTo protect our country, we reorganized our Government and created the Department\nof Homeland Security, which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era. To\nbring our economy out of recession, we delivered the largest tax relief in a\ngeneration. To insist on integrity in American business, we passed tough\nreforms, and we are holding corporate criminals to account.Some might call this a good record. I call it a good start. Tonight I ask the\nHouse and the Senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow\ncitizens.Our first goal is clear: We must have an economy that grows fast enough to\nemploy every man and woman who seeks a job. After recession, terrorist attacks,\ncorporate scandals, and stock market declines, our economy is recovering. Yet,\nit's not growing fast enough or strongly enough. With unemployment rising, our\nNation needs more small businesses to open, more companies to invest and expand,\nmore employers to put up the sign that says, \"Help Wanted.\" Jobs are created\nwhen the economy grows. The economy grows when Americans have more money to\nspend and invest, and the best and fairest way to make sure Americans have that\nmoney is not to tax it away in the first place.I am proposing that all the income-tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be made\npermanent and effective this year. And under my plan, as soon as I've signed the\nbill, this extra money will start showing up in workers' paychecks. Instead of\ngradually reducing the marriage penalty, we should do it now. Instead of slowly\nraising the child credit to $1,000, we should send the checks to American\nfamilies now.The tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes, and it will help our\neconomy immediately: 92 million Americans will keep, this year, an average of\nalmost $1,100 more of their own money; a family of 4 with an income of $40,000\nwould see their Federal income taxes fall from $1,178 to $45 per year; our plan\nwill improve the bottom line for more than 23 million small businesses.You, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions and promised them\nfor future years. If this tax relief is good for Americans 3, or 5, or 7 years\nfrom now, it is even better for Americans today.We should also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax\nlaws. It's fair to tax a company's profits. It is not fair to again tax the\nshareholder on the same profits. To boost investor confidence and to help the\nnearly 10 million seniors who receive dividend income, I ask you to end the\nunfair double taxation of dividends.Lower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand. More jobs mean\nmore taxpayers and higher revenues to our Government. The best way to address\nthe deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growth\nand to show some spending discipline in Washington, DC.We must work together to fund only our most important priorities. I will send\nyou a budget that increases discretionary spending by 4 percent next year, about\nas much as the average family's income is expected to grow. And that is a good\nbenchmark for us. Federal spending should not rise any faster than the paychecks\nof American families.A growing economy and a focus on essential priorities will be crucial to the\nfuture of Social Security. As we continue to work together to keep Social\nSecurity sound and reliable, we must offer younger workers a chance to invest in\nretirement accounts that they will control and they will own.Our second goal is high quality, affordable health for all Americans. The\nAmerican system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation, with a pace of\ndiscovery that is adding good years to our lives. Yet for many people, medical\ncare costs too much, and many have no health coverage at all. These problems\nwill not be solved with a nationalized health care system that dictates coverage\nand rations care.Instead, we must work toward a system in which all Americans have a good\ninsurance policy, choose their own doctors, and seniors and low- income\nAmericans receive the help they need. Instead of bureaucrats and trial lawyers\nand HMOs, we must put doctors and nurses and patients back in charge of American\nmedicine.Health care reform must begin with Medicare. Medicare is the binding commitment\nof a caring society. We must renew that commitment by giving seniors access to\npreventive medicine and new drugs that are transforming health care in America.Seniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep their\ncoverage just the way it is. And just like you, the Members of Congress, and\nyour staffs and other Federal employees, all seniors should have the choice of a\nhealth care plan that provides prescription drugs.My budget will commit an additional $400 billion over the next decade to reform\nand strengthen Medicare. Leaders of both political parties have talked for years\nabout strengthening Medicare. I urge the Members of this new Congress to act\nthis year.To improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime causes of\nhigher cost, the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly\nsued. Because of excessive litigation, everybody pays more for health care, and\nmany parts of America are losing fine doctors. No one has ever been healed by a\nfrivolous lawsuit. I urge the Congress to pass medical liability reform.Our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country, while\ndramatically improving the environment. I have sent you a comprehensive energy\nplan to promote energy efficiency and conservation, to develop cleaner\ntechnology, and to produce more energy at home. I have sent you Clear Skies\nlegislation that mandates a 70-percent cut in air pollution from powerplants\nover the next 15 years. I have sent you a Healthy Forests Initiative, to help\nprevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities, kill wildlife, and\nburn away millions of acres of treasured forests.I urge you to pass these measures, for the good of both our environment and our\neconomy. Even more, I ask you to take a crucial step and protect our environment\nin ways that generations before us could not have imagined.In this century, the greatest environmental progress will come about not through\nendless lawsuits or command-and-control regulations but through technology and\ninnovation. Tonight I'm proposing $1.2 billion in research funding so that\nAmerica can lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen-powered automobiles.A simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy, which\ncan be used to power a car, producing only water, not exhaust fumes. With a new\nnational commitment, our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to\ntaking these cars from laboratory to showroom, so that the first car driven by a\nchild born today could be powered by hydrogen and pollution-free. Join me in\nthis important innovation to make our air significantly cleaner and our country\nmuch less dependent on foreign sources of energy.Our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest problems of\nAmerica. For so many in our country, the homeless and the fatherless, the\naddicted, the need is great. Yet there's power, wonder- working power, in the\ngoodness and idealism and faith of the American people.Americans are doing the work of compassion every day, visiting prisoners,\nproviding shelter for battered women, bringing companionship to lonely seniors.\nThese good works deserve our praise. They deserve our personal support, and when\nappropriate, they deserve the assistance of the Federal Government.I urge you to pass both my Faith-Based Initiative and the Citizen Service Act,\nto encourage acts of compassion that can transform America, one heart and one\nsoul at a time.Last year, I called on my fellow citizens to participate in the USA Freedom\nCorps, which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across America.\nTonight I ask Congress and the American people to focus the spirit of service\nand the resources of Government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable\ncitizens, boys and girls trying to grow up without guidance and attention and\nchildren who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad.\nI propose a $450 million initiative to bring mentors to more than a million\ndisadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners. Government will\nsupport the training and recruiting of mentors. Yet it is the men and women of\nAmerica who will fill the need. One mentor, one person can change a life\nforever, and I urge you to be that one person.Another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs. Addiction crowds out\nfriendship, ambition, moral conviction and reduces all the richness of life to a\nsingle destructive desire. As a government, we are fighting illegal drugs by\ncutting off supplies and reducing demand through antidrug education programs.\nYet for those already addicted, the fight against drugs is a fight for their own\nlives. Too many Americans in search of treatment cannot get it. So tonight I\npropose a new $600 million program to help an additional 300,000 Americans\nreceive treatment over the next 3 years.Our Nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work. One of them\nis found at the Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A man in the\nprogram said, \"God does miracles in people's lives, and you never think it\ncould be you.\" Tonight let us bring to all Americans who struggle with drug\naddiction this message of hope: The miracle of recovery is possible, and it\ncould be you.By caring for children who need mentors and for addicted men and women who need\ntreatment, we are building a more welcoming society, a culture that values every\nlife. And in this work, we must not overlook the weakest among us. I ask you to\nprotect infants at the very hour of their birth and end the practice of\npartial-birth abortion. And because no human life should be started or ended as\nthe object of an experiment, I ask you to set a high standard for humanity and\npass a law against all human cloning.The qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America also\ndetermine our conduct abroad. The American flag stands for more than our power\nand our interests. Our Founders dedicated this country to the cause of human\ndignity, the rights of every person, and the possibilities of every life. This\nconviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted and defend the peace\nand confound the designs of evil men.In Afghanistan, we helped to liberate an oppressed people. And we will continue\nhelping them secure their country, rebuild their society, and educate all their\nchildren, boys and girls. In the Middle East, we will continue to seek peace\nbetween a secure Israel and a democratic Palestine. Across the Earth, America is\nfeeding the hungry. More than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a\ngift from the people of the United States. As our Nation moves troops and builds\nalliances to make our world safer, we must also remember our calling as a\nblessed country is to make the world better.Today, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30 million people have the AIDS virus,\nincluding 3 million children under the age 15. There are whole countries in\nAfrica where more than one-third of the adult population carries the infection.\nMore than 4 million require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent,\nonly 50,000 AIDS victims-- only 50,000--are receiving the medicine they need.Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek\ntreatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africa\ndescribes his frustration. He says, \"We have no medicines. Many hospitals tell\npeople, 'You've got AIDS. We can't help you. Go home and die.' \" In an age of\nmiraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words.AIDS can be prevented. Antiretroviral drugs can extend life for many years. And\nthe cost of those drugs has dropped from $12,000 a year to under $300 a year,\nwhich places a tremendous possibility within our grasp. Ladies and gentlemen,\nseldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many.We have confronted and will continue to confront HIV/AIDS in our own country.\nAnd to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad, tonight I propose the Emergency\nPlan for AIDS Relief, a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts\nto help the people of Africa. This comprehensive plan will prevent 7 million new\nAIDS infections, treat at least 2 million people with life-extending drugs, and\nprovide humane care for millions of people suffering from AIDS and for children\norphaned by AIDS. I ask the Congress to commit $15 billion over the next 5\nyears, including nearly $10 billion in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS\nin the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean.This Nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of\nnature. And this Nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the\nmanmade evil of international terrorism.There are days when our fellow citizens do not hear news about the war on\nterror. There's never a day when I do not learn of another threat or receive\nreports of operations in progress or give an order in this global war against a\nscattered network of killers. The war goes on, and we are winning.To date, we've arrested or otherwise dealt with many key commanders of Al Qaida.\nThey include a man who directed logistics and funding for the September the 11th\nattacks, the chief of Al Qaida operations in the Persian Gulf who planned the\nbombings of our embassies in east Africa and the U.S.S. Cole, an Al Qaida\noperations chief from Southeast Asia, a former director of Al Qaida's training\ncamps in Afghanistan, a key Al Qaida operative in Europe, a major Al Qaida\nleader in Yemen. All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been\narrested in many countries. Many others have met a different fate. Let's put it\nthis way: They are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends and\nallies.We are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks. America\nand coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies\ntargeting the Embassy in Yemen, the American Embassy in Singapore, a Saudi\nmilitary base, ships in the Straits of Hormuz and the Straits of Gibraltar.\nWe've broken Al Qaida cells in Hamburg, Milan, Madrid, London, Paris, as well as\nBuffalo, New York.We have the terrorists on the run. We're keeping them on the run. One by one,\nthe terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice.As we fight this war, we will remember where it began: Here, in our own country.\nThis Government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and\ndefend our homeland. We've intensified security at the borders and ports of\nentry, posted more than 50,000 newly trained Federal screeners in airports,\nbegun inoculating troops and first- responders against smallpox, and are\ndeploying the Nation's first early warning network of sensors to detect\nbiological attack. And this year, for the first time, we are beginning to field\na defense to protect this Nation against ballistic missiles.I thank the Congress for supporting these measures. I ask you tonight to add to\nour future security with a major research and production effort to guard our\npeople against bioterrorism, called Project BioShield. The budget I send you\nwill propose almost $6 billion to quickly make available effective vaccines and\ntreatments against agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, Ebola, and plague. We\nmust assume that our enemies would use these diseases as weapons, and we must\nact before the dangers are upon us.Since September the 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have\nworked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists. The FBI is\nimproving its ability to analyze intelligence and is transforming itself to meet\nnew threats. Tonight I am instructing the leaders of the FBI, the CIA, the\nHomeland Security, and the Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat\nIntegration Center, to merge and analyze all threat information in a single\nlocation. Our Government must have the very best information possible, and we\nwill use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect all\nour citizens.Our war against terror is a contest of will in which perseverance is power. In\nthe ruins of two towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon, on a field in\nPennsylvania, this Nation made a pledge, and we renew that pledge tonight:\nWhatever the duration of this struggle and whatever the difficulties, we will\nnot permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men; free people will set\nthe course of history.Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing\nAmerica and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear,\nchemical, and biological weapons. These regimes could use such weapons for\nblackmail, terror, and mass murder. They could also give or sell those weapons\nto terrorist allies, who would use them without the least hesitation.This threat is new. America's duty is familiar. Throughout the 20th century,\nsmall groups of men seized control of great nations, built armies and arsenals,\nand set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world. In each case, their\nambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit. In each case, the ambitions of\nHitlerism, militarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples,\nby the strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States of\nAmerica.Now, in this century, the ideology of power and domination has appeared again\nand seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror. Once again, this Nation and\nall our friends are all that stand between a world at peace and a world of chaos\nand constant alarm. Once again, we are called to defend the safety of our people\nand the hopes of all mankind. And we accept this responsibility.America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers. We\nhave called on the United Nations to fulfill its charter and stand by its demand\nthat Iraq disarm. We're strongly supporting the International Atomic Energy\nAgency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world.\nWe're working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the former\nSoviet Union and to strengthen global treaties banning the production and\nshipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction.In all these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow a\nprocess; it is to achieve a result, the end of terrible threats to the civilized\nworld. All free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic\nattacks. And we're asking them to join us, and many are doing so. Yet the course\nof this Nation does not depend on the decisions of others. Whatever action is\nrequired, whenever action is necessary, I will defend the freedom and security\nof the American people.Different threats require different strategies. In Iran, we continue to see a\nGovernment that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, and\nsupports terror. We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as\nthey speak out for liberty and human rights and democracy. Iranians, like all\npeople, have a right to choose their own Government and determine their own\ndestiny, and the United States supports their aspirations to live in freedom.On the Korean Peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and\nstarvation. Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiated\nframework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear weapons. We now know that\nthat regime was deceiving the world and developing those weapons all along. And\ntoday the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and\nseek concessions. America and the world will not be blackmailed.America is working with the countries of the region, South Korea, Japan, China,\nand Russia, to find a peaceful solution and to show the North Korean Government\nthat nuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and\ncontinued hardship. The North Korean regime will find respect in the world and\nrevival for its people only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions.Our Nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean Peninsula and not\nallow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal dictator, with a\nhistory of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential\nwealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United\nStates.Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty\nin a war he had started and lost. To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of all\nweapons of mass destruction. For the next 12 years, he systematically violated\nthat agreement. He pursued chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, even while\ninspectors were in his country. Nothing to date has restrained him from his\npursuit of these weapons, not economic sanctions, not isolation from the\ncivilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities.Almost 3 months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his\nfinal chance to disarm. He has shown instead utter contempt for the United\nNations and for the opinion of the world. The 108 U.N. inspectors were sent to\nconduct--were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a\ncountry the size of California. The job of the inspectors is to verify that\nIraq's regime is disarming. It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding\nits banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy them\nas directed. Nothing like this has happened.The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons\nsufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax, enough doses to kill\nseveral million people. He hasn't accounted for that material. He's given no\nevidence that he has destroyed it. The United Nations concluded that Saddam\nHussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum\ntoxin, enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure. He\nhasn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed\nit. Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to\nproduce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard, and VX nerve agent. In such\nquantities, these chemical agents could also kill untold thousands. He's not\naccounted for these materials. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed\nthem. U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000\nmunitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up\n16 of them, despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence. Saddam\nHussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited\nmunitions. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them.From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several\nmobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce germ warfare\nagents and can be moved from place to a place to evade inspectors. Saddam\nHussein has not disclosed these facilities. He's given no evidence that he has\ndestroyed them.The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam\nHussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a\nnuclear weapon, and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium\nfor a bomb. The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently\nsought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources\ntell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable\nfor nuclear weapons production. Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these\nactivities. He clearly has much to hide.The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary, he is deceiving. From\nintelligence sources we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security\npersonnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the U.N. inspectors,\nsanitizing inspection sites, and monitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqi\nofficials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses.Iraq is blocking U-2 surveillance flights requested by the United Nations. Iraqi\nintelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to\ninterview. Real scientists have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say.\nIntelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists\nwho cooperate with U.N. inspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed, along with\ntheir families.Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous\nsums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction. But why?\nThe only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for those\nweapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or attack.With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam\nHussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create\ndeadly havoc in that region. And this Congress and the American people must\nrecognize another threat. Evidence from intelligence sources, secret\ncommunications, and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam\nHussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of Al Qaida. Secretly\nand without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons to\nterrorists or help them develop their own.Before September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could\nbe contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses, and shadowy terrorist\nnetworks are not easily contained. Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons\nand other plans, this time armed by Saddam Hussein. It would take one vial, one\ncanister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none\nwe have ever known. We will do everything in our power to make sure that that\nday never comes.Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since when have\nterrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice\nbefore they strike? If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge,\nall actions, all words, and all recriminations would come too late. Trusting in\nthe sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an\noption.The dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has already\nused them on whole villages, leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind,\nor disfigured. Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained, by\ntorturing children while their parents are made to watch. International human\nrights groups have cataloged other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq:\nelectric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation\nwith electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape. If this is not evil, then\nevil has no meaning.And tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your\nenemy is not surrounding your country; your enemy is ruling your country. And\nthe day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your\nliberation.The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept a\nserious and mounting threat to our country and our friends and our allies. The\nUnited States will ask the U.N. Security Council to convene on February the 5th\nto consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world. Secretary of\nState Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraqi's\nlegal--Iraq's illegal weapons programs, its attempt to hide those weapons from\ninspectors, and its links to terrorist groups.We will consult. But let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does\nnot fully disarm, for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world,\nwe will lead a coalition to disarm him.Tonight I have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace, members\nof the American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling in or near the Middle\nEast, and some crucial hours may lay ahead. In those hours, the success of our\ncause will depend on you. Your training has prepared you. Your honor will guide\nyou. You believe in America, and America believes in you.Sending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a President can\nmake. The technologies of war have changed; the risks and suffering of war have\nnot. For the brave Americans who bear the risk, no victory is free from sorrow.\nThis Nation fights reluctantly, because we know the cost and we dread the days\nof mourning that always come.We seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be defended. A\nfuture lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all. If war is\nforced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by just means, sparing, in\nevery way we can, the innocent. And if war is forced upon us, we will fight with\nthe full force and might of the United States military, and we will prevail.And as we and our coalition partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will bring to\nthe Iraqi people food and medicines and supplies and freedom.Many challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season. In 2\nyears, America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of\nperil, from bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes. And\nwe go forward with confidence, because this call of history has come to the\nright country.Americans are a resolute people who have risen to every test of our time.\nAdversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world and to\nourselves. America is a strong nation and honorable in the use of our strength.\nWe exercise power without conquest, and we sacrifice for the liberty of\nstrangers.Americans are a free people, who know that freedom is the right of every person\nand the future of every nation. The liberty we prize is not America's gift to\nthe world, it is God's gift to humanity.We Americans have faith in ourselves, but not in ourselves alone. We do not\nknow--we do not claim to know all the ways of providence, yet we can trust in\nthem, placing our confidence in the loving God behind all of life and all of\nhistory.May He guide us now. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.",
