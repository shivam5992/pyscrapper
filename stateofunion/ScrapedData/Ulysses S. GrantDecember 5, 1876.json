    "date": "December 5, 1876", 
    "speech": "To the Senate and House of Representatives:In submitting my eighth and last annual message to Congress it seems proper\nthat I should refer to and in some degree recapitulate the events and\nofficial acts of the past eight years.It was my fortune, or misfortune, to be called to the office of Chief\nExecutive without any previous political training. From the age of 17 I had\nnever even witnessed the excitement attending a Presidential campaign but\ntwice antecedent to my own candidacy, and at but one of them was I eligible\nas a voter.Under such circumstances it is but reasonable to suppose that errors of\njudgment must have occurred. Even had they not, differences of opinion\nbetween the Executive, bound by an oath to the strict performance of his\nduties, and writers and debaters must have arisen. It is not necessarily\nevidence of blunder on the part of the Executive because there are these\ndifferences of views. Mistakes have been made, as all can see and I admit,\nbut it seems to me oftener in the selections made of the assistants\nappointed to aid in carrying out the various duties of administering the\nGovernment--in nearly every case selected without a personal acquaintance\nwith the appointee, but upon recommendations of the representatives chosen\ndirectly by the people. It is impossible, where so many trusts are to be\nallotted, that the right parties should be chosen in every instance.\nHistory shows that no Administration from the time of Washington to the\npresent has been free from these mistakes. But I leave comparisons to\nhistory, claiming only that I have acted in every instance from a\nconscientious desire to do what was right, constitutional, within the law,\nand for the very best interests of the whole people. Failures have been\nerrors of judgment, not of intent.My civil career commenced, too, at a most critical and difficult time. Less\nthan four years before, the country had emerged from a conflict such as no\nother nation had ever survived. Nearly one-half of the States had revolted\nagainst the Government, and of those remaining faithful to the Union a\nlarge percentage of the population sympathized with the rebellion and made\nan \"enemy in the rear\" almost as dangerous as the more honorable enemy in\nthe front. The latter committed errors of judgment, but they maintained\nthem openly and courageously; the former received the protection of the\nGovernment they would see destroyed, and reaped all the pecuniary advantage\nto be gained out of the then existing state of affairs, many of them by\nobtaining contracts and by swindling the Government in the delivery of\ntheir goods.Immediately on the cessation of hostilities the then noble President, who\nhad carried the country so far through its perils, fell a martyr to his\npatriotism at the hands of an assassin.The intervening time to my first inauguration was filled up with wranglings\nbetween Congress and the new Executive as to the best mode of\n\"reconstruction,\" or, to speak plainly, as to whether the control of the\nGovernment should be thrown immediately into the hands of those who had so\nrecently and persistently tried to destroy it, or whether the victors\nshould continue to have an equal voice with them in this control.\nReconstruction, as finally agreed upon, means this and only this, except\nthat the late slave was enfranchised, giving an increase, as was supposed,\nto the Union-loving and Union-supporting votes. If free in the full sense\nof the word, they would not disappoint this expectation. Hence at the\nbeginning of my first Administration the work of reconstruction, much\nembarrassed by the long delay, virtually commenced. It was the work of the\nlegislative branch of the Government. My province was wholly in approving\ntheir acts, which I did most heartily, urging the legislatures of States\nthat had not yet done so to ratify the fifteenth amendment to the\nConstitution. The country was laboring under an enormous debt, contracted\nin the suppression of rebellion, and taxation was so oppressive as to\ndiscourage production. Another danger also threatened us--a foreign war.\nThe last difficulty had to be adjusted and was adjusted without a war and\nin a manner highly honorable to all parties concerned. Taxes have been\nreduced within the last seven years nearly $300,000,000, and the national\ndebt has been reduced in the same time over $435,000,000. By refunding the\n6 per cent bonded debt for bonds bearing 5 and 4 1/2 per cent interest,\nrespectively, the annual interest has been reduced from over $130,000,000\nin 1869 to but little over $100,000,000 in 1876. The balance of trade has\nbeen changed from over $130,000,000 against the United States in 1869 to\nmore than $120,000,000 in our favor in 1876.It is confidently believed that the balance of trade in favor of the United\nStates will increase, not diminish, and that the pledge of Congress to\nresume specie payments in 1879 will be easily accomplished, even in the\nabsence of much-desired further legislation on the subject.A policy has been adopted toward the Indian tribes inhabiting a large\nportion of the territory of the United States which has been humane and has\nsubstantially ended Indian hostilities in the whole land except in a\nportion of Nebraska, and Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana Territories--the\nBlack Hills region and approaches thereto. Hostilities there have grown out\nof the avarice of the white man, who has violated our treaty stipulations\nin his search for gold. The question might be asked why the Government has\nnot enforced obedience to the terms of the treaty prohibiting the\noccupation of the Black Hills region by whites. The answer is simple: The\nfirst immigrants to the Black Hills were removed by troops, but rumors of\nrich discoveries of gold took into that region increased numbers. Gold has\nactually been found in paying quantity, and an effort to remove the miners\nwould only result in the desertion of the bulk of the troops that might be\nsent there to remove them. All difficulty in this matter has, however, been\nremoved--subject to the approval of Congress--by a treaty ceding the Black\nHills and approaches to settlement by citizens.The subject of Indian policy and treatment is so fully set forth by the\nSecretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and my\nviews so fully expressed therein, that I refer to their reports and\nrecommendations as my own.The relations of the United States with foreign powers continue on a\nfriendly footing.Questions have arisen from time to time in the foreign relations of the\nGovernment, but the United States have been happily free during the past\nyear from the complications and embarrassments which have surrounded some\nof the foreign powers.The diplomatic correspondence submitted herewith contains information as to\ncertain of the matters which have occupied the Government.The cordiality which attends our relations with the powers of the earth has\nbeen plainly shown by the general participation of foreign nations in the\nexhibition which has just closed and by the exertions made by distant\npowers to show their interest in and friendly feelings toward the United\nStates in the commemoration of the centennial of the nation. The Government\nand people of the United States have not only fully appreciated this\nexhibition of kindly feeling, but it may be justly and fairly expected that\nno small benefits will result both to ourselves and other nations from a\nbetter acquaintance, and a better appreciation of our mutual advantages and\nmutual wants.Congress at its last session saw fit to reduce the amount usually\nappropriated for foreign intercourse by withholding appropriations for\nrepresentatives of the United States in certain foreign countries and for\ncertain consular officers, and by reducing the amounts usually appropriated\nfor certain other diplomatic posts, and thus necessitating a change in the\ngrade of the representatives. For these reasons, immediately upon the\npassage of the bill making appropriations for the diplomatic and consular\nservice for the present fiscal year, instructions were issued to the\nrepresentatives of the United States at Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia, and\nto the consular officers for whom no appropriation had been made, to close\ntheir respective legations and consulates and cease from the performance of\ntheir duties; and in like manner steps were immediately taken to substitute\ncharge's d'affaires for ministers resident in Portugal, Denmark, Greece,\nSwitzerland, and Paraguay.While thoroughly impressed with the wisdom of sound economy in the foreign\nservice, as in other branches of the Government, I can not escape the\nconclusion that in some instances the withholding of appropriations will\nprove an expensive economy, and that the small retrenchment secured by a\nchange of grade in certain diplomatic posts is not an adequate\nconsideration for the loss of influence and importance which will attend\nour foreign representatives under this reduction. I am of the opinion that\na reexamination of the subject will cause a change in some instances in the\nconclusions reached on these subjects at the last session of Congress.The Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims, whose functions were\ncontinued by an act of the last session of Congress until the 1st day of\nJanuary, 1877, has carried on its labors with diligence and general\nsatisfaction. By a report from the clerk of the court, transmitted\nherewith, bearing date November 14, 1876, it appears that within the time\nnow allowed by law the court will have disposed of all the claims presented\nfor adjudication. This report also contains a statement of the general\nresults of the labors of the court to the date thereof. It is a cause of\nsatisfaction that the method adopted for the satisfaction of the classes of\nclaims submitted to the court, which are of long standing and justly\nentitled to early consideration, should have proved successful and\nacceptable.It is with satisfaction that I am enabled to state that the work of the\njoint commission for determining the boundary line between the United\nStates and British possessions from the northwest angle of the Lake of the\nWoods to the Rocky Mountains, commenced in 1872, has been completed. The\nfinal agreements of the commissioners, with the maps, have been duly\nsigned, and the work of the commission is complete.The fixing of the boundary upon the Pacific coast by the protocol of March\n10, 1873, pursuant to the award of the Emperor of Germany by Article XXXIV\nof the treaty of Washington, with the termination of the work of this\ncommission, adjusts and fixes the entire boundary between the United States\nand the British possessions, except as to the portion of territory ceded by\nRussia to the United States under the treaty of 1867. The work intrusted to\nthe commissioner and the officers of the Army attached to the commission\nhas been well and satisfactorily performed. The original of the final\nagreement of the commissioners, signed upon the 29th of May, 1876, with the\noriginal official \"lists of astronomical stations observed,\" the original\nofficial \"list of monuments marking the international boundary line,\" and\nthe maps, records, and general reports relating to the commission, have\nbeen deposited in the Department of State. The official report of the\ncommissioner on the part of the United States, with the report of the chief\nastronomer of the United States, will be submitted to Congress within a\nshort time.I reserve for a separate communication to Congress a statement of the\ncondition of the questions which lately arose with Great Britain respecting\nthe surrender of fugitive criminals under the treaty of 1842.The Ottoman Government gave notice, under date of January 15, 1874, of its\ndesire to terminate the treaty of 1862, concerning commerce and navigation,\npursuant to the provisions of the twenty-second article thereof. Under this\nnotice the treaty terminated upon the 5th day of June, 1876. That\nGovernment has invited negotiations toward the conclusion of a new treaty.By the act of Congress of March 23, 1874, the President was authorized,\nwhen he should receive satisfactory information that the Ottoman Government\nor that of Egypt had organized new tribunals likely to secure to citizens\nof the United States the same impartial justice enjoyed under the exercise\nof judicial functions by diplomatic and consular officers of the United\nStates, to suspend the operation of the act of June 22, 1860, and to accept\nfor citizens of the United States the jurisdiction of the new tribunals.\nSatisfactory information having been received of the organization of such\nnew tribunals in Egypt, I caused a proclamation to be issued upon the 27th\nof March last, suspending the operation of the act of June 22, 1860, in\nEgypt, according to the provisions of the act. A copy of the proclamation\naccompanies this message. The United States has united with the other\npowers in the organization of these courts. It is hoped that the\njurisdictional questions which have arisen may be readily adjusted, and\nthat this advance in judicial reform may be hindered by no obstacles.The necessary legislation to carry into effect the convention respecting\ncommercial reciprocity concluded with the Hawaiian Islands in 1875 having\nbeen had, the proclamation to carry into effect the convention, as provided\nby the act approved August 15, 1876, was duly issued upon the 9th day of\nSeptember last. A copy thereof accompanies this message.The commotions which have been prevalent in Mexico for some time past, and\nwhich, unhappily, seem to be not yet wholly quieted, have led to complaints\nof citizens of the United States of injuries by persons in authority. It is\nhoped, however, that these will ultimately be adjusted to the satisfaction\nof both Governments. The frontier of the United States in that quarter has\nnot been exempt from acts of violence by citizens of one Republic on those\nof the other. The frequency of these is supposed to be increased and their\nadjustment made more difficult by the considerable changes in the course of\nthe lower part of the Rio Grande River, which river is a part of the\nboundary between the two countries. These changes have placed on either\nside of that river portions of land which by existing conventions belong to\nthe jurisdiction of the Government on the opposite side of the river. The\nsubject of adjustment of this cause of difficulty is under consideration\nbetween the two Republics.The Government of the United States of Colombia has paid the award in the\ncase of the steamer Montijo, seized by authorities of that Government some\nyears since, and the amount has been transferred to the claimants.It is with satisfaction that I am able to announce that the joint\ncommission for the adjustment of claims between the United States and\nMexico under the convention of 1868, the duration of which has been several\ntimes extended, has brought its labors to a close. From the report of the\nagent of the United States, which accompanies the papers transmitted\nherewith, it will be seen that within the time limited by the commission\n1,017 claims on the part of citizens of the United States against Mexico\nwere referred to the commission. Of these claims 831 were dismissed or\ndisallowed, and in 186 cases awards were made in favor of the claimants\nagainst the Mexican Republic, amounting in the aggregate to $4,125,622.20.\nWithin the same period 998 claims on the part of citizens of the Mexican\nRepublic against the United States were referred to the commission. Of\nthese claims 831 were dismissed or disallowed, and in 167 cases awards were\nmade in favor of the claimants against the United States, amounting in the\naggregate to $150,498.41.By the terms of the convention the amount of these awards is to be deducted\nfrom the amount awarded in favor of our citizens against Mexico, and the\nbalance only to be paid by Mexico to the United States, leaving the United\nStates to make provision for this proportion of the awards in favor of its\nOwn citizens.I invite your attention to the legislation which will be necessary to\nprovide for the payment.In this connection I am pleased to be able to express the acknowledgments\ndue to Sir Edward Thornton, the umpire of the commission, who has given to\nthe consideration of the large number of claims submitted to him much time,\nunwearied patience, and that firmness and intelligence which are well known\nto belong to the accomplished representative of Great Britain, and which\nare likewise recognized by the representative in this country of the\nRepublic of Mexico.Monthly payments of a very small part of the amount due by the Government\nof Venezuela to citizens of the United States on account of claims of the\nlatter against that Government continue to be made with reasonable\npunctuality. That Government has proposed to change the system which it has\nhitherto pursued in this respect by issuing bonds for part of the amount of\nthe several claims. The proposition, however, could not, it is supposed,\nproperly be accepted, at least without the consent of the holders of\ncertificates of the indebtedness of Venezuela. These are so much dispersed\nthat it would be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain their\ndisposition on the subject.In former messages I have called the attention of Congress to the necessity\nof legislation with regard to fraudulent naturalization and to the subject\nof expatriation and the election of nationality.The numbers of persons of foreign birth seeking a home in the United\nStates, the ease and facility with which the honest emigrant may, after the\nlapse of a reasonable time, become possessed of all the privileges of\ncitizenship of the United States, and the frequent occasions which induce\nsuch adopted citizens to return to the country of their birth render the\nsubject of naturalization and the safeguards which experience has proved\nnecessary for the protection of the honest naturalized citizen of paramount\nimportance. The very simplicity in the requirements of law on this question\naffords opportunity for fraud, and the want of uniformity in the\nproceedings and records of the various courts and in the forms of the\ncertificates of naturalization issued affords a constant source of\ndifficulty.I suggest no additional requirements to the acquisition of citizenship\nbeyond those now existing, but I invite the earnest attention of Congress\nto the necessity and wisdom of some provisions regarding uniformity in the\nrecords and certificates, and providing against the frauds which frequently\ntake place and for the vacating of a record of naturalization obtained in\nfraud.These provisions are needed in aid and for the protection of the honest\ncitizen of foreign birth, and for the want of which he is made to suffer\nnot infrequently. The United States has insisted upon the right of\nexpatriation, and has obtained, after a long struggle, an admission of the\nprinciple contended for by acquiescence therein on the part of many foreign\npowers and by the conclusion of treaties on that subject. It is, however,\nbut justice to the government to which such naturalized citizens have\nformerly owed allegiance, as well as to the United States, that certain\nfixed and definite rules should be adopted governing such cases and\nproviding how expatriation may be accomplished.While emigrants in large numbers become citizens of the United States, it\nis also true that persons, both native born and naturalized, once citizens\nof the United States, either by formal acts or as the effect of a series of\nfacts and circumstances, abandon their citizenship and cease to be entitled\nto the protection of the United States, but continue on convenient\noccasions to assert a claim to protection in the absence of provisions on\nthese questions.And in this connection I again invite your attention to the necessity of\nlegislation concerning the marriages of American citizens contracted\nabroad, and concerning the status of American women who may marry\nforeigners and of children born of American parents in a foreign country.The delicate and complicated questions continually occurring with reference\nto naturalization, expatriation, and the status of such persons as I have\nabove referred to induce me to earnestly direct your attention again to\nthese subjects.In like manner I repeat my recommendation that some means be provided for\nthe hearing and determination of the just and subsisting claims of aliens\nupon the Government of the United States within a reasonable limitation,\nand of such as may hereafter arise. While by existing provisions of law the\nCourt of Claims may in certain cases be resorted to by an alien claimant,\nthe absence of any general provisions governing all such cases and the want\nof a tribunal skilled in the disposition of such cases upon recognized\nfixed and settled principles, either provides no remedy in many deserving\ncases or compels a consideration of such claims by Congress or the\nexecutive department of the Government.It is believed that other governments are in advance of the United States\nupon this question, and that the practice now adopted is entirely\nunsatisfactory.Congress, by an act approved the 3d day of March, 1875, authorized the\ninhabitants of the Territory of Colorado to form a State government, with\nthe name of the State of Colorado, and therein provided for the admission\nof said State, when formed, into the Union upon an equal footing with the\noriginal States.A constitution having been adopted and ratified by the people of that\nState, and the acting governor having certified to me the facts as provided\nby said act, together with a copy of such constitution and ordinances as\nprovided for in the said act, and the provisions of the said act of\nCongress having been duly complied with, I issued a proclamation upon the\n1st of August, 1876, a copy of which is hereto annexed.The report of the Secretary of War shows that the Army has been actively\nemployed during the year in subduing, at the request of the Indian Bureau,\ncertain wild bands of the Sioux Indian Nation and in preserving the peace\nat the South during the election. The commission constituted under the act\nof July 24, 1876, to consider and report on the \"whole subject of the\nreform and reorganization of the Army\" met in August last, and has\ncollected a large mass of statistics and opinions bearing on the subject\nbefore it. These are now under consideration, and their report is\nprogressing. I am advised, though, by the president of the commission that\nit will be impracticable to comply with the clause of the act requiring the\nreport to be presented, through me, to Congress on the first day of this\nsession, as there has not yet been time for that mature deliberation which\nthe importance of the subject demands. Therefore I ask that the time of\nmaking the report be extended to the 29th day of January, 1877.In accordance with the resolution of August 15, 1876, the Army regulations\nprepared under the act of March 1, 1875, have not been promulgated, but are\nheld until after the report of the above-mentioned commission shall have\nbeen received and acted on.By the act of August 15, 1876, the cavalry force of the Army was increased\nby 2,500 men, with the proviso that they should be discharged on the\nexpiration of hostilities. Under this authority the cavalry regiments have\nbeen strengthened, and a portion of them are now in the field pursuing the\nremnants of the Indians with whom they have been engaged during the\nsummer.The estimates of the War Department are made up on the basis of the number\nof men authorized by law, and their requirements as shown by years of\nexperience, and also with the purpose on the part of the bureau officers to\nprovide for all contingencies that may arise during the time for which the\nestimates are made. Exclusive of engineer estimates (presented in\naccordance with acts of Congress calling for surveys and estimates for\nimprovements at various localities), the estimates now presented are about\nsix millions in excess of the appropriations for the years 1874-75 and\n1875-76. This increase is asked in order to provide for the increased\ncavalry force (should their services be necessary), to prosecute\neconomically work upon important public buildings, to provide for armament\nof fortifications and manufacture of small arms, and to replenish the\nworking stock in the supply departments. The appropriations for these last\nnamed have for the past few years been so limited that the accumulations in\nstore will be entirely exhausted during the present year, and it will be\nnecessary to at once begin to replenish them.I invite your special attention to the following recommendations of the\nSecretary of War:First. That the claims under the act of July 4, 1864, for supplies taken by\nthe Army during the war be removed from the offices of the Quartermaster\nand Commissary Generals and transferred to the Southern Claims Commission.\nThese claims are of precisely similar nature to those now before the\nSouthern Claims Commission, and the War Department bureaus have not the\nclerical force for their examination nor proper machinery for investigating\nthe loyalty of the claimants.Second. That Congress sanction the scheme of an annuity fund for the\nbenefit of the families of deceased officers, and that it also provide for\nthe permanent organization of the Signal Service, both of which were\nrecommended in my last annual message.Third. That the manufacturing operations of the Ordnance Department be\nconcentrated at three arsenals and an armory, and that the remaining\narsenals be sold and the proceeds applied to this object by the Ordnance\nDepartment.The appropriations for river and harbor improvements for the current year\nwere $5,015,000. With my approval, the Secretary of War directed that of\nthis amount $2,000,000 should be expended, and no new works should be begun\nand none prosecuted which were not of national importance. Subsequently\nthis amount was increased to $2,237,600, and the works are now progressing\non this basis.The improvement of the South Pass of the Mississippi River, under James B.\nEads and his associates, is progressing favorably. At the present time\nthere is a channel of 20.3 feet in depth between the jetties at the mouth\nof the pass and 18.5 feet at the head of the pass. Neither channel,\nhowever, has the width required before payments can be made by the United\nStates. A commission of engineer officers is now examining these works, and\ntheir reports will be presented as soon as received.The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that branch of the service to\nbe in condition as effective as it is possible to keep it with the means\nand authority given the Department. It is, of course, not possible to rival\nthe costly and progressive establishments of great European powers with the\nold material of our Navy, to which no increase has been authorized since\nthe war, except the eight small cruisers built to supply the place of\nothers which had gone to decay. Yet the most has been done that was\npossible with the means at command; and by substantially rebuilding some of\nour old ships with durable material and completely repairing and refitting\nour monitor fleet the Navy has been gradually so brought up that, though it\ndoes not maintain its relative position among the progressive navies of the\nworld, it is now in a condition more powerful and effective than it ever\nhas been in time of peace.The complete repairs of our five heavy ironclads are only delayed on\naccount of the inadequacy of the appropriations made last year for the\nworking bureaus of the Department, which were actually less in amount than\nthose made before the war, notwithstanding the greatly enhanced price of\nlabor and materials and the increase in the cost of the naval service\ngrowing out of the universal use and great expense of steam machinery. The\nmoney necessary for these repairs should be provided at once, that they may\nbe completed without further unnecessary delay and expense.When this is done, all the strength that there is in our Navy will be\ndeveloped and useful to its full capacity, and it will be powerful for\npurposes of defense, and also for offensive action, should the necessity\nfor that arise within a reasonable distance from our shores.The fact that our Navy is not more modern and powerful than it is has been\nmade a cause of complaint against the Secretary of the Navy by persons who\nat the same time criticise and complain of his endeavors to bring the Navy\nthat we have to its best and most efficient condition; but the good sense\nof the country will understand that it is really due to his practical\naction that we have at this time any effective naval force at command.The report of the Postmaster-General shows the excess of expenditures\n(excluding expenditures on account of previous years) over receipts for the\nfiscal year ended June 30, 1876, to be $4,151,988.66.Estimated expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1878, are\n$36,723,432.43.Estimated revenue for same period is $30,645,165, leaving estimated excess\nof expenditure, to be appropriated as a deficiency, of $6,078,267.43.The Postmaster-General, like his predecessor, is convinced that a change in\nthe basis of adjusting the salaries of postmasters of the fourth class is\nnecessary for the good of the service as well as for the interests of the\nGovernment, and urgently recommends that the compensation of the class of\npostmasters above mentioned be based upon the business of their respective\noffices, as ascertained from the sworn returns to the Auditor of stamps\ncanceled.A few postmasters in the Southern States have expressed great apprehension\nof their personal safety on account of their connection with the postal\nservice, and have specially requested that their reports of apprehended\ndanger should not be made public lest it should result in the loss of their\nlives. But no positive testimony of interference has been submitted, except\nin the case of a mail messenger at Spartanburg, in South Carolina, who\nreported that he had been violently driven away while in charge of the\nmails on account of his political affiliations. An assistant superintendent\nof the Railway Mail Service investigated this case and reported that the\nmessenger had disappeared from his post, leaving his work to be performed\nby a substitute. The Postmaster-General thinks this case is sufficiently\nsuggestive to justify him in recommending that a more severe punishment\nshould be provided for the offense of assaulting any person in charge of\nthe mails or of retarding or otherwise obstructing them by threats of\npersonal injury.\"A very gratifying result is presented in the fact that the deficiency of\nthis Department during the last fiscal year was reduced to $4,081,790.18,\nas against $6,169,938.88 of the preceding year. The difference can be\ntraced to the large increase in its ordinary receipts (which greatly exceed\nthe estimates therefor) and a slight decrease in its expenditures.\"The ordinary receipts of the Post-Office Department for the past seven\nfiscal years have increased at an average of over 8 per cent per annum,\nwhile the increase of expenditures for the same period has been but about\n5.50 per cent per annum, and the decrease of deficiency in the revenues has\nbeen at the rate of nearly 2 per cent per annum.The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture accompanying this message\nwill be found one of great interest, marking, as it does, the great\nprogress of the last century in the variety of products of the soil;\nincreased knowledge and skill in the labor of producing, saving, and\nmanipulating the same to prepare them for the use of man; in the\nimprovements in machinery to aid the agriculturist in his labors, and in a\nknowledge of those scientific subjects necessary to a thorough system of\neconomy in agricultural production, namely, chemistry, botany, entomology,\netc. A study of this report by those interested in agriculture and deriving\ntheir support from it will find it of value in pointing out those articles\nwhich are raised in greater quantity than the needs of the world require,\nand must sell, therefore, for less than the cost of production, and those\nwhich command a profit over cost of production because there is not an\noverproduction.I call special attention to the need of the Department for a new gallery\nfor the reception of the exhibits returned from the Centennial Exhibition,\nincluding the exhibits donated by very many foreign nations, and to the\nrecommendations of the Commissioner of Agriculture generally.The reports of the District Commissioners and the board of health are just\nreceived--too late to read them and to make recommendations thereon--and\nare herewith submitted.The international exhibition held in Philadelphia this year, in\ncommemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of American independence,\nhas proven a great success, and will, no doubt, be of enduring advantage to\nthe country. It has shown the great progress in the arts, sciences, and\nmechanical skill made in a single century, and demonstrated that we are but\nlittle behind older nations in any one branch, while in some we scarcely\nhave a rival. It has served, too, not only to bring peoples and products of\nskill and labor from all parts of the world together, but in bringing\ntogether people from all sections of our own country, which must prove a\ngreat benefit in the information imparted and pride of country engendered.It has been suggested by scientists interested in and connected with the\nSmithsonian Institution, in a communication herewith, that the Government\nexhibit be removed to the capital and a suitable building be erected or\npurchased for its accommodation as a permanent exhibit. I earnestly\nrecommend this; and believing that Congress would second this view, I\ndirected that all Government exhibits at the Centennial Exhibition should\nremain where they are, except such as might be injured by remaining in a\nbuilding not intended as a protection in inclement weather, or such as may\nbe wanted by the Department furnishing them, until the question of\npermanent exhibition is acted on.Although the moneys appropriated by Congress to enable the participation of\nthe several Executive Departments in the International Exhibition of 1876\nwere not sufficient to carry out the undertaking to the full extent at\nfirst contemplated, it gives me pleasure to refer to the very efficient and\ncreditable manner in which the board appointed from these several\nDepartments to provide an exhibition on the part of the Government have\ndischarged their duties with the funds placed at their command. Without a\nprecedent to guide them in the preparation of such a display, the success\nof their labors was amply attested by the sustained attention which the\ncontents of the Government building attracted during the period of the\nexhibition from both foreign and native visitors.I am strongly impressed with the value of the collection made by the\nGovernment for the purposes of the exhibition, illustrating, as it does,\nthe mineral resources of the country, the statistical and practical\nevidences of our growth as a nation, and the uses of the mechanical arts\nand the applications of applied science in the administration of the\naffairs of Government.Many nations have voluntarily contributed their exhibits to the United\nStates to increase the interest in any permanent exhibition Congress may\nprovide for. For this act of generosity they should receive the thanks of\nthe people, and I respectfully suggest that a resolution of Congress to\nthat effect be adopted.The attention of Congress can not be too earnestly called to the necessity\nof throwing some greater safeguard over the method of choosing and\ndeclaring the election of a President. Under the present system there seems\nto be no provided remedy for contesting the election in any one State. The\nremedy is partially, no doubt, in the enlightenment of electors. The\ncompulsory support of the free school and the disfranchisement of all who\ncan not read and write the English language, after a fixed probation, would\nmeet my hearty approval. I would not make this apply, however, to those\nalready voters, but I would to all becoming so after the expiration of the\nprobation fixed upon. Foreigners coming to this country to become citizens,\nwho are educated in their own language, should acquire the requisite\nknowledge of ours during the necessary residence to obtain naturalization.\nIf they did not take interest enough in our language to acquire sufficient\nknowledge of it to enable them to study the institutions and laws of the\ncountry intelligently, I would not confer upon them the right to make such\nlaws nor to select those who do.I append to this message, for convenient reference, a synopsis of\nadministrative events and of all recommendations to Congress made by me\nduring the last seven years. Time may show some of these recommendations\nnot to have been wisely conceived, but I believe the larger part will do no\ndiscredit to the Administration. One of these recommendations met with the\nunited opposition of one political party in the Senate and with a strong\nopposition from the other, namely, the treaty for the annexation of Santo\nDomingo to the United States, to which I will specially refer, maintaining,\nas I do, that if my views had been concurred in the country would be in a\nmore prosperous condition to-day, both politically and financially.Santo Domingo is fertile, and upon its soil may be grown just those\ntropical products of which the United States use so much, and which are\nproduced or prepared for market now by slave labor almost exclusively,\nnamely, sugar, coffee, dyewoods, mahogany, tropical fruits, tobacco, etc.\nAbout 75 per cent of the exports of Cuba are consumed in the United States.\nA large percentage of the exports of Brazil also find the same market.\nThese are paid for almost exclusively in coin, legislation, particularly in\nCuba, being unfavorable to a mutual exchange of the products of each\ncountry. Flour shipped from the Mississippi River to Havana can pass by the\nvery entrance to the city on its way to a port in Spain, there pay a duty\nfixed upon articles to be reexported, transferred to a Spanish vessel and\nbrought back almost to the point of starting, paying a second duty, and\nstill leave a profit over what would be received by direct shipment. All\nthat is produced in Cuba could be produced in Santo Domingo. Being a part\nof the United States, commerce between the island and mainland would be\nfree. There would be no export duties on her shipments nor import duties on\nthose coming here. There would be no import duties upon the supplies,\nmachinery, etc., going from the States. The effect that would have been\nproduced upon Cuban commerce, with these advantages to a rival, is\nobservable at a glance. The Cuban question would have been settled long ago\nin favor of \"free Cuba.\" Hundreds of American vessels would now be\nadvantageously used in transporting the valuable woods and other products\nof the soil of the island to a market and in carrying supplies and\nemigrants to it. The island is but sparsely settled, while it has an area\nsufficient for the profitable employment of several millions of people. The\nsoil would have soon fallen into the hands of United States capitalists.\nThe products are so valuable in commerce that emigration there would have\nbeen encouraged; the emancipated race of the South would have found there a\ncongenial home, where their civil rights would not be disputed and where\ntheir labor would be so much sought after that the poorest among them could\nhave found the means to go. Thus in cases of great oppression and cruelty,\nsuch as has been practiced upon them in many places within the last eleven\nyears, whole communities would have sought refuge in Santo Domingo. I do\nnot suppose the whole race would have gone, nor is it desirable that they\nshould go. Their labor is desirable--indispensable almost--where they now\nare. But the possession of this territory would have left the negro \"master\nof the situation,\" by enabling him to demand his rights at home on pain of\nfinding them elsewhere.I do not present these views now as a recommendation for a renewal of the\nsubject of annexation, but I do refer to it to vindicate my previous action\nin regard to it.With the present term of Congress my official life terminates. It is not\nprobable that public affairs will ever again receive attention from me\nfurther than as a citizen of the Republic, always taking a deep interest in\nthe honor, integrity, and prosperity of the whole land.U.
