    "speech": "To the Senate and House of Representatives:FINANCES.The financial standing of the Nation at the present time is excellent,\nand the financial management of the Nation's interests by the\nGovernment during the last seven years has shown the most satisfactory\nresults. But our currency system is imperfect, and it is earnestly to\nbe hoped that the Currency Commission will be able to propose a\nthoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects.During the period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1908, there was\nan increase in the amount of money in circulation of $902,991,399. The\nincrease in the per capita during this period was $7.06. Within this\ntime there were several occasions when it was necessary for the\nTreasury Department to come to the relief of the money market by\npurchases or redemptions of United States bonds; by increasing deposits\nin national banks; by stimulating additional issues of national bank\nnotes, and by facilitating importations from abroad of gold. Our\nimperfect currency system has made these proceedings necessary, and\nthey were effective until the monetary disturbance in the fall of 1907\nimmensely increased the difficulty of ordinary methods of relief. By\nthe middle of November the available working balance in the Treasury\nhad been reduced to approximately $5,000,000. Clearing house\nassociations throughout the country had been obliged to resort to the\nexpedient of issuing clearing house certificates, to be used as money.\nIn this emergency it was determined to invite subscriptions for\n$50,000,000 Panama Canal bonds, and $100,000,000 three per cent\ncertificates of indebtedness authorized by the act of June 13, 1898. It\nwas proposed to re-deposit in the national banks the proceeds of these\nissues, and to permit their use as a basis for additional circulating\nnotes of national banks. The moral effect of this procedure was so\ngreat that it was necessary to issue only $24,631,980 of the Panama\nCanal bonds and $15,436,500 of the certificates of indebtedness.During the period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1908, the balance\nbetween the net ordinary receipts and the net ordinary expenses of the\nGovernment showed a surplus in the four years 1902, 1903, 1906 and\n1907, and a deficit in the years 1904, 1905, 1908 and a fractional part\nof the fiscal year 1909. The net result was a surplus of\n$99,283,413.54. The financial operations of the Government during this\nperiod, based upon these differences between receipts and expenditures,\nresulted in a net reduction of the interest-bearing debt of the United\nStates from $987,141,040 to $897,253,990, notwithstanding that there\nhad been two sales of Panama Canal bonds amounting in the aggregate to\n$54,631,980, and an issue of three per cent certificates of\nindebtedness under the act of June 13, 1998, amounting to $15,436,500.\nRefunding operations of the Treasury Department under the act of March\n14, 1900, resulted in the conversion into two per cent consols of 1930\nof $200,309,400 bonds bearing higher rates of interest. A decrease of\n$8,687,956 in the annual interest charge resulted from these\noperations.In short, during the seven years and three months there has been a net\nsurplus of nearly one hundred millions of receipts over expenditures, a\nreduction of the interest-bearing debt by ninety millions, in spite of\nthe extraordinary expense of the Panama Canal, and a saving of nearly\nnine millions on the annual interest charge. This is an exceedingly\nsatisfactory showing, especially in view of the fact that during this\nperiod the Nation has never hesitated to undertake any expenditure that\nit regarded as necessary. There have been no new taxes and no increase\nof taxes; on the contrary, some taxes have been taken off; there has\nbeen a reduction of taxation.CORPORATIONS.As regards the great corporations engaged in interstate business, and\nespecially the railroad, I can only repeat what I have already again\nand again said in my messages to the Congress, I believe that under the\ninterstate clause of the Constitution the United States has complete\nand paramount right to control all agencies of interstate commerce, and\nI believe that the National Government alone can exercise this right\nwith wisdom and effectiveness so as both to secure justice from, and to\ndo justice to, the great corporations which are the most important\nfactors in modern business. I believe that it is worse than folly to\nattempt to prohibit all combinations as is done by the Sherman\nanti-trust law, because such a law can be enforced only imperfectly and\nunequally, and its enforcement works almost as much hardship as good. I\nstrongly advocate that instead of an unwise effort to prohibit all\ncombinations there shall be substituted a law which shall expressly\npermit combinations which are in the interest of the public, but shall\nat the same time give to some agency of the National Government full\npower of control and supervision over them. One of the chief features\nof this control should be securing entire publicity in all matters\nwhich the public has a right to know, and furthermore, the power, not\nby judicial but by executive action, to prevent or put a stop to every\nform of improper favoritism or other wrongdoing.The railways of the country should be put completely under the\nInterstate Commerce Commission and removed from the domain of the\nanti-trust law. The power of the Commission should be made\nthoroughgoing, so that it could exercise complete supervision and\ncontrol over the issue of securities as well as over the raising and\nlowering of rates. As regards rates, at least, this power should be\nsummary. The power to investigate the financial operations and accounts\nof the railways has been one of the most valuable features in recent\nlegislation. Power to make combinations and traffic agreements should\nbe explicitly conferred upon the railroads, the permission of the\nCommission being first gained and the combination or agreement being\npublished in all its details. In the interest of the public the\nrepresentatives of the public should have complete power to see that\nthe railroads do their duty by the public, and as a matter of course\nthis power should also be exercised so as to see that no injustice is\ndone to the railroads. The shareholders, the employees and the shippers\nall have interests that must be guarded. It is to the interest of all\nof them that no swindling stock speculation should be allowed, and that\nthere should be no improper issuance of securities. The guiding\nintelligences necessary for the successful building and successful\nmanagement of railroads should receive ample remuneration; but no man\nshould be allowed to make money in connection with railroads out of\nfraudulent over-capitalization and kindred stock-gambling performances;\nthere must be no defrauding of investors, oppression of the farmers and\nbusiness men who ship freight, or callous disregard of the rights and\nneeds of the employees. In addition to this the interests of the\nshareholders, of the employees, and of the shippers should all be\nguarded as against one another. To give any one of them undue and\nimproper consideration is to do injustice to the others. Rates must be\nmade as low as is compatible with giving proper returns to all the\nemployees of the railroad, from the highest to the lowest, and proper\nreturns to the shareholders; but they must not, for instance, be\nreduced in such fashion as to necessitate a cut in the wages of the\nemployees or the abolition of the proper and legitimate profits of\nhonest shareholders.Telegraph and telephone companies engaged in interstate business should\nbe put under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission.It is very earnestly to be wished that our people, through their\nrepresentatives, should act in this matter. It is hard to say whether\nmost damage to the country at large would come from entire failure on\nthe part of the public to supervise and control the actions of the\ngreat corporations, or from the exercise of the necessary governmental\npower in a way which would do injustice and wrong to the corporations.\nBoth the preachers of an unrestricted individualism, and the preachers\nof an oppression which would deny to able men of business the just\nreward of their initiative and business sagacity, are advocating\npolicies that would be fraught with the gravest harm to the whole\ncountry. To permit every lawless capitalist, every law-defying\ncorporation, to take any action, no matter how iniquitous, in the\neffort to secure an improper profit and to build up privilege, would be\nruinous to the Republic and would mark the abandonment of the effort to\nsecure in the industrial world the spirit of democratic fair dealing.\nOn the other hand, to attack these wrongs in that spirit of demagogy\nwhich can see wrong only when committed by the man of wealth, and is\ndumb and blind in the presence of wrong committed against men of\nproperty or by men of no property, is exactly as evil as corruptly to\ndefend the wrongdoing of men of wealth. The war we wage must be waged\nagainst misconduct, against wrongdoing wherever it is found; and we\nmust stand heartily for the rights of every decent man, whether he be a\nman of great wealth or a man who earns his livelihood as a wage-worker\nor a tiller of the soil.It is to the interest of all of us that there should be a premium put\nupon individual initiative and individual capacity, and an ample reward\nfor the great directing intelligences alone competent to manage the\ngreat business operations of to-day. It is well to keep in mind that\nexactly as the anarchist is the worst enemy of liberty and the\nreactionary the worst enemy of order, so the men who defend the rights\nof property have most to fear from the wrongdoers of great wealth, and\nthe men who are championing popular rights have most to fear from the\ndemagogues who in the name of popular rights would do wrong to and\noppress honest business men, honest men of wealth; for the success of\neither type of wrongdoer necessarily invites a violent reaction against\nthe cause the wrongdoer nominally upholds. In point of danger to the\nNation there is nothing to choose between on the one hand the\ncorruptionist, the bribe-giver, the bribe-taker, the man who employs\nhis great talent to swindle his fellow-citizens on a large scale, and,\non the other hand, the preacher of class hatred, the man who, whether\nfrom ignorance or from willingness to sacrifice his country to his\nambition, persuades well-meaning but wrong-headed men to try to destroy\nthe instruments upon which our prosperity mainly rests. Let each group\nof men beware of and guard against the shortcomings to which that group\nis itself most liable. Too often we see the business community in a\nspirit of unhealthy class consciousness deplore the effort to hold to\naccount under the law the wealthy men who in their management of great\ncorporations, whether railroads, street railways, or other industrial\nenterprises, have behaved in a way that revolts the conscience of the\nplain, decent people. Such an attitude can not be condemned too\nseverely, for men of property should recognize that they jeopardize the\nrights of property when they fail heartily to join in the effort to do\naway with the abuses of wealth. On the other hand, those who advocate\nproper control on behalf of the public, through the State, of these\ngreat corporations, and of the wealth engaged on a giant scale in\nbusiness operations, must ever keep in mind that unless they do\nscrupulous justice to the corporation, unless they permit ample profit,\nand cordially encourage capable men of business so long as they act\nwith honesty, they are striking at the root of our national well-being;\nfor in the long run, under the mere pressure of material distress, the\npeople as a whole would probably go back to the reign of an\nunrestricted individualism rather than submit to a control by the State\nso drastic and so foolish, conceived in a spirit of such unreasonable\nand narrow hostility to wealth, as to prevent business operations from\nbeing profitable, and therefore to bring ruin upon the entire business\ncommunity, and ultimately upon the entire body of citizens.The opposition to Government control of these great corporations makes\nits most effective effort in the shape of an appeal to the old doctrine\nof State's rights. Of course there are many sincere men who now believe\nin unrestricted individualism in business, just as there were formerly\nmany sincere men who believed in slavery--that is, in the unrestricted\nright of an individual to own another individual. These men do not by\nthemselves have great weight, however. The effective fight against\nadequate Government control and supervision of individual, and\nespecially of corporate, wealth engaged in interstate business is\nchiefly done under cover; and especially under cover of an appeal to\nState's rights. It is not at all infrequent to read in the same speech\na denunciation of predatory wealth fostered by special privilege and\ndefiant of both the public welfare and law of the land, and a\ndenunciation of centralization in the Central Government of the power\nto deal with this centralized and organized wealth. Of course the\npolicy set forth in such twin denunciations amounts to absolutely\nnothing, for the first half is nullified by the second half. The chief\nreason, among the many sound and compelling reasons, that led to the\nformation of the National Government was the absolute need that the\nUnion, and not the several States, should deal with interstate and\nforeign commerce; and the power to deal with interstate commerce was\ngranted absolutely and plenarily to the Central Government and was\nexercised completely as regards the only instruments of interstate\ncommerce known in those days--the waterways, the highroads, as well as\nthe partnerships of individuals who then conducted all of what business\nthere was. Interstate commerce is now chiefly conducted by railroads;\nand the great corporation has supplanted the mass of small partnerships\nor individuals. The proposal to make the National Government supreme\nover, and therefore to give it complete control over, the railroads and\nother instruments of interstate commerce is merely a proposal to carry\nout to the letter one of the prime purposes, if not the prime purpose,\nfor which the Constitution was rounded. It does not represent\ncentralization. It represents merely the acknowledgment of the patent\nfact that centralization has already come in business. If this\nirresponsible outside business power is to be controlled in the\ninterest of the general public it can only be controlled in one way--by\ngiving adequate power of control to the one sovereignty capable of\nexercising such power--the National Government. Forty or fifty separate\nstate governments can not exercise that power over corporations doing\nbusiness in most or all of them; first, because they absolutely lack\nthe authority to deal with interstate business in any form; and second,\nbecause of the inevitable conflict of authority sure to arise in the\neffort to enforce different kinds of state regulation, often\ninconsistent with one another and sometimes oppressive in themselves.\nSuch divided authority can not regulate commerce with wisdom and\neffect. The Central Government is the only power which, without\noppression, can nevertheless thoroughly and adequately control and\nsupervise the large corporations. To abandon the effort for National\ncontrol means to abandon the effort for all adequate control and yet to\nrender likely continual bursts of action by State legislatures, which\ncan not achieve the purpose sought for, but which can do a great deal\nof damage to the corporation without conferring any real benefit on the\npublic.I believe that the more farsighted corporations are themselves coming\nto recognize the unwisdom of the violent hostility they have displayed\nduring the last few years to regulation and control by the National\nGovernment of combinations engaged in interstate business. The truth is\nthat we who believe in this movement of asserting and exercising a\ngenuine control, in the public interest, over these great corporations\nhave to contend against two sets of enemies, who, though nominally\nopposed to one another, are really allies in preventing a proper\nsolution of the problem. There are, first, the big corporation men, and\nthe extreme individualists among business men, who genuinely believe in\nutterly unregulated business that is, in the reign of plutocracy; and,\nsecond, the men who, being blind to the economic movements of the day,\nbelieve in a movement of repression rather than of regulation of\ncorporations, and who denounce both the power of the railroads and the\nexercise of the Federal power which alone can really control the\nrailroads. Those who believe in efficient national control, on the\nother hand, do not in the least object to combinations; do not in the\nleast object to concentration in business administration. On the\ncontrary, they favor both, with the all important proviso that there\nshall be such publicity about their workings, and such thoroughgoing\ncontrol over them, as to insure their being in the interest, and not\nagainst the interest, of the general public. We do not object to the\nconcentration of wealth and administration; but we do believe in the\ndistribution of the wealth in profits to the real owners, and in\nsecuring to the public the full benefit of the concentrated\nadministration. We believe that with concentration in administration\nthere can come both be advantage of a larger ownership and of a more\nequitable distribution of profits, and at the same time a better\nservice to the commonwealth. We believe that the administration should\nbe for the benefit of the many; and that greed and rascality, practiced\non a large scale, should be punished as relentlessly as if practiced on\na small scale.We do not for a moment believe that the problem will be solved by any\nshort and easy method. The solution will come only by pressing various\nconcurrent remedies. Some of these remedies must lie outside the domain\nof all government. Some must lie outside the domain of the Federal\nGovernment. But there is legislation which the Federal Government alone\ncan enact and which is absolutely vital in order to secure the\nattainment of our purpose. Many laws are needed. There should be\nregulation by the National Government of the great interstate\ncorporations, including a simple method of account keeping, publicity,\nsupervision of the issue securities, abolition of rebates, and of\nspecial privileges. There should be short time franchises for all\ncorporations engaged in public business; including the corporations\nwhich get power from water rights. There should be National as well as\nState guardianship of mines and forests. The labor legislation\nhereinafter referred to should concurrently be enacted into law.To accomplish this, means of course a certain increase in the use\nof--not the creation of--power, by the Central Government. The power\nalready exists; it does not have to be created; the only question is\nwhether it shall be used or left idle--and meanwhile the corporations\nover which the power ought to be exercised will not remain idle. Let\nthose who object to this increase in the use of the only power\navailable, the national power, be frank, and admit openly that they\npropose to abandon any effort to control the great business\ncorporations and to exercise supervision over the accumulation and\ndistribution of wealth; for such supervision and control can only come\nthrough this particular kind of increase of power. We no more believe\nin that empiricism which demand, absolutely unrestrained individualism\nthan we do in that empiricism which clamors for a deadening socialism\nwhich would destroy all individual initiative and would ruin the\ncountry with a completeness that not even an unrestrained individualism\nitself could achieve. The danger to American democracy lies not in the\nleast in the concentration of administrative power in responsible and\naccountable hands. It lies in having the power insufficiently\nconcentrated, so that no one can be held responsible to the people for\nits use. Concentrated power is palpable, visible, responsible, easily\nreached, quickly held to account. Power scattered through many\nadministrators, many legislators, many men who work behind and through\nlegislators and administrators, is impalpable, is unseen, is\nirresponsible, can not be reached, can not be held to account.\nDemocracy is in peril wherever the administration of political power is\nscattered among a variety of men who work in secret, whose very names\nare unknown to the common people. It is not in peril from any man who\nderives authority from the people, who exercises it in sight of the\npeople, and who is from time to time compelled to give an account of\nits exercise to the people.LABOR.There are many matters affecting labor and the status of the\nwage-worker to which I should like to draw your attention, but an\nexhaustive discussion of the problem in all its aspects is not now\nnecessary. This administration is nearing its end; and, moreover, under\nour form of government the solution of the problem depends upon the\naction of the States as much as upon the action of the Nation.\nNevertheless, there are certain considerations which I wish to set\nbefore you, because I hope that our people will more and more keep them\nin mind. A blind and ignorant resistance to every effort for the reform\nof abuses and for the readjustment of society to modern industrial\nconditions represents not true conservatism, but an incitement to the\nwildest radicalism; for wise radicalism and wise conservatism go hand\nin hand, one bent on progress, the other bent on seeing that no change\nis made unless in the right direction. I believe in a steady effort, or\nperhaps it would be more accurate to say in steady efforts in many\ndifferent directions, to bring about a condition of affairs under which\nthe men who work with hand or with brain, the laborers, the\nsuperintendents, the men who produce for the market and the men who\nfind a market for the articles produced, shall own a far greater share\nthan at present of the wealth they produce, and be enabled to invest it\nin the tools and instruments by which all work is carried on. As far as\npossible I hope to see a frank recognition of the advantages conferred\nby machinery, organization, and division of labor, accompanied by an\neffort to bring about a larger share in the ownership by wage-worker of\nrailway, mill and factory. In farming, this simply means that we wish\nto see the farmer own his own land; we do not wish to see the farms so\nlarge that they become the property of absentee landlords who farm them\nby tenants, nor yet so small that the farmer becomes like a European\npeasant. Again, the depositors in our savings banks now number over\none-tenth of our entire population. These are all capitalists, who\nthrough the savings banks loan their money to the workers--that is, in\nmany cases to themselves--to carry on their various industries. The\nmore we increase their number, the more we introduce the principles of\ncooperation into our industry. Every increase in the number of small\nstockholders in corporations is a good thing, for the same reasons; and\nwhere the employees are the stockholders the result is particularly\ngood. Very much of this movement must be outside of anything that can\nbe accomplished by legislation; but legislation can do a good deal.\nPostal savings banks will make it easy for the poorest to keep their\nsavings in absolute safety. The regulation of the national highways\nmust be such that they shall serve all people with equal justice.\nCorporate finances must be supervised so as to make it far safer than\nat present for the man of small means to invest his money in stocks.\nThere must be prohibition of child labor, diminution of woman labor,\nshortening of hours of all mechanical labor; stock watering should be\nprohibited, and stock gambling so far as is possible discouraged. There\nshould be a progressive inheritance tax on large fortunes. Industrial\neducation should be encouraged. As far as possible we should lighten\nthe burden of taxation on the small man. We should put a premium upon\nthrift, hard work, and business energy; but these qualities cease to be\nthe main factors in accumulating a fortune long before that fortune\nreaches a point where it would be seriously affected by any inheritance\ntax such as I propose. It is eminently right that the Nation should fix\nthe terms upon which the great fortunes are inherited. They rarely do\ngood and they often do harm to those who inherit them in their\nentirety.PROTECTION FOR WAGEWORKERS.The above is the merest sketch, hardly even a sketch in outline, of the\nreforms for which we should work. But there is one matter with which\nthe Congress should deal at this session. There should no longer be any\npaltering with the question of taking care of the wage-workers who,\nunder our present industrial system, become killed, crippled, or worn\nout as part of the regular incidents of a given business. The majority\nof wageworkers must have their rights secured for them by State action;\nbut the National Government should legislate in thoroughgoing and\nfar-reaching fashion not only for all employees of the National\nGovernment, but for all persons engaged in interstate commerce. The\nobject sought for could be achieved to a measurable degree, as far as\nthose killed or crippled are concerned, by proper employers' liability\nlaws. As far as concerns those who have been worn out, I call your\nattention to the fact that definite steps toward providing old-age\npensions have been taken in many of our private industries. These may\nbe indefinitely extended through voluntary association and contributory\nschemes, or through the agency of savings banks, as under the recent\nMassachusetts plan. To strengthen these practical measures should be\nour immediate duty; it is not at present necessary to consider the\nlarger and more general governmental schemes that most European\ngovernments have found themselves obliged to adopt.Our present system, or rather no system, works dreadful wrong, and is\nof benefit to only one class of people--the lawyers. When a workman is\ninjured what he needs is not an expensive and doubtful lawsuit, but the\ncertainty of relief through immediate administrative action. The number\nof accidents which result in the death or crippling of wageworkers, in\nthe Union at large, is simply appalling; in a very few years it runs up\na total far in excess of the aggregate of the dead and wounded in any\nmodern war. No academic theory about \"freedom of contract\" or\n\"constitutional liberty to contract\" should be permitted to interfere\nwith this and similar movements. Progress in civilization has\neverywhere meant a limitation and regulation of contract. I call your\nespecial attention to the bulletin of the Bureau of Labor which gives a\nstatement of the methods of treating the unemployed in European\ncountries, as this is a subject which in Germany, for instance, is\ntreated in connection with making provision for worn-out and crippled\nworkmen.Pending a thoroughgoing investigation and action there is certain\nlegislation which should be enacted at once. The law, passed at the\nlast session of the Congress, granting compensation to certain classes\nof employees of the Government, should be extended to include all\nemployees of the Government and should be made more liberal in its\nterms. There is no good ground for the distinction made in the law\nbetween those engaged in hazardous occupations and those not so\nengaged. If a man is injured or killed in any line of work, it was\nhazardous in his case. Whether 1 per cent or 10 per cent of those\nfollowing a given occupation actually suffer injury or death ought not\nto have any bearing on the question of their receiving compensation. It\nis a grim logic which says to an injured employee or to the dependents\nof one killed that he or they are entitled to no compensation because\nvery few people other than he have been injured or killed in that\noccupation. Perhaps one of the most striking omissions in the law is\nthat it does not embrace peace officers and others whose lives may be\nsacrificed in enforcing the laws of the United States. The terms of the\nact providing compensation should be made more liberal than in the\npresent act. A year's compensation is not adequate for a wage-earner's\nfamily in the event of his death by accident in the course of his\nemployment. And in the event of death occurring, say, ten or eleven\nmonths after the accident, the family would only receive as\ncompensation the equivalent of one or two months' earnings. In this\nrespect the generosity of the United States towards its employees\ncompares most unfavorably with that of every country in Europe--even\nthe poorest.The terms of the act are also a hardship in prohibiting payment in\ncases where the accident is in any way due to the negligence of the\nemployee. It is inevitable that daily familiarity with danger will lead\nmen to take chances that can be construed into negligence. So well is\nthis recognized that in practically all countries in the civilized\nworld, except the United States, only a great degree of negligence acts\nas a bar to securing compensation. Probably in no other respect is our\nlegislation, both State and National, so far behind practically the\nentire civilized world as in the matter of liability and compensation\nfor accidents in industry. It is humiliating that at European\ninternational congresses on accidents the United States should be\nsingled out as the most belated among the nations in respect to\nemployers' liability legislation. This Government is itself a large\nemployer of labor, and in its dealings with its employees it should set\na standard in this country which would place it on a par with the most\nprogressive countries in Europe. The laws of the United States in this\nrespect and the laws of European countries have been summarized in a\nrecent Bulletin of the Bureau of Labor, and no American who reads this\nsummary can fail to be struck by the great contrast between our\npractices and theirs--a contrast not in any sense to our credit.The Congress should without further delay pass a model employers'\nliability law for the District of Columbia. The employers' liability\nact recently declared unconstitutional, on account of apparently\nincluding in its provisions employees engaged in intrastate commerce as\nwell as those engaged in interstate commerce, has been held by the\nlocal courts to be still in effect so far as its provisions apply to\nDistrict of Columbia. There should be no ambiguity on this point. If\nthere is any doubt on the subject, the law should be reenacted with\nspecial reference to the District of Columbia. This act, however,\napplies only to employees of common carriers. In all other occupations\nthe liability law of the District is the old common law. The severity\nand injustice of the common law in this matter has been in some degree\nor another modified in the majority of our States, and the only\njurisdiction under the exclusive control of the Congress should be\nahead and not behind the States of the Union in this respect. A\ncomprehensive employers' liability law should be passed for the\nDistrict of Columbia.I renew my recommendation made in a previous message that half-holidays\nbe granted during summer to all wageworkers in Government employ.I also renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight-hour day\nshould as rapidly and as far as practicable be extended to the entire\nwork being carried on by the Government; the present law should be\namended to embrace contracts on those public works which the present\nwording of the act seems to exclude.THE COURTS.I most earnestly urge upon the Congress the duty of increasing the\ntotally inadequate salaries now given to our Judges. On the whole there\nis no body of public servants who do as valuable work, nor whose\nmoneyed reward is so inadequate compared to their work. Beginning with\nthe Supreme Court, the Judges should have their salaries doubled. It is\nnot befitting the dignity of the Nation that its most honored public\nservants should be paid sums so small compared to what they would earn\nin private life that the performance of public service by them implies\nan exceedingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice.It is earnestly to be desired that some method should be devised for\ndoing away with the long delays which now obtain in the administration\nof justice, and which operate with peculiar severity against persons of\nsmall means, and favor only the very criminals whom it is most\ndesirable to punish. These long delays in the final decisions of cases\nmake in the aggregate a crying evil; and a remedy should be devised.\nMuch of this intolerable delay is due to improper regard paid to\ntechnicalities which are a mere hindrance to justice. In some noted\nrecent cases this over-regard for technicalities has resulted in a\nstriking denial of justice, and flagrant wrong to the body politic.At the last election certain leaders of organized labor made a violent\nand sweeping attack upon the entire judiciary of the country, an attack\ncouched in such terms as to include the most upright, honest and\nbroad-minded judges, no less than those of narrower mind and more\nrestricted outlook. It was the kind of attack admirably fitted to\nprevent any successful attempt to reform abuses of the judiciary,\nbecause it gave the champions of the unjust judge their eagerly desired\nopportunity to shift their ground into a championship of just judges\nwho were unjustly assailed. Last year, before the House Committee on\nthe Judiciary, these same labor leaders formulated their demands,\nspecifying the bill that contained them, refusing all compromise,\nstating they wished the principle of that bill or nothing. They\ninsisted on a provision that in a labor dispute no injunction should\nissue except to protect a property right, and specifically provided\nthat the right to carry on business should not be construed as a\nproperty right; and in a second provision their bill made legal in a\nlabor dispute any act or agreement by or between two or more persons\nthat would not have been unlawful if done by a single person. In other\nwords, this bill legalized blacklisting and boycotting in every form,\nlegalizing, for instance, those forms of the secondary boycott which\nthe anthracite coal strike commission so unreservedly condemned; while\nthe right to carry on a business was explicitly taken out from under\nthat protection which the law throws over property. The demand was made\nthat there should be trial by jury in contempt cases, thereby most\nseriously impairing the authority of the courts. All this represented a\ncourse of policy which, if carried out, would mean the enthronement of\nclass privilege in its crudest and most brutal form, and the\ndestruction of one of the most essential functions of the judiciary in\nall civilized lands.The violence of the crusade for this legislation, and its complete\nfailure, illustrate two truths which it is essential our people should\nlearn. In the first place, they ought to teach the workingman, the\nlaborer, the wageworker, that by demanding what is improper and\nimpossible he plays into the hands of his foes. Such a crude and\nvicious attack upon the courts, even if it were temporarily successful,\nwould inevitably in the end cause a violent reaction and would band the\ngreat mass of citizens together, forcing them to stand by all the\njudges, competent and incompetent alike, rather than to see the wheels\nof justice stopped. A movement of this kind can ultimately result in\nnothing but damage to those in whose behalf it is nominally undertaken.\nThis is a most healthy truth, which it is wise for all our people to\nlearn. Any movement based on that class hatred which at times assumes\nthe name of \"class consciousness\" is certain ultimately to fail, and if\nit temporarily succeeds, to do far-reaching damage. \"Class\nconsciousness,\" where it is merely another name for the odious vice of\nclass selfishness, is equally noxious whether in an employer's\nassociation or in a workingman's association. The movement in question\nwas one in which the appeal was made to all workingmen to vote\nprimarily, not as American citizens, but as individuals of a certain\nclass in society. Such an appeal in the first place revolts the more\nhigh-minded and far-sighted among the persons to whom it is addressed,\nand in the second place tends to arouse a strong antagonism among all\nother classes of citizens, whom it therefore tends to unite against the\nvery organization on whose behalf it is issued. The result is therefore\nunfortunate from every standpoint. This healthy truth, by the way, will\nbe learned by the socialists if they ever succeed in establishing in\nthis country an important national party based on such class\nconsciousness and selfish class interest.The wageworkers, the workingmen, the laboring men of the country, by\nthe way in which they repudiated the effort to get them to cast their\nvotes in response to an appeal to class hatred, have emphasized their\nsound patriotism and Americanism. The whole country has cause to fell\npride in this attitude of sturdy independence, in this uncompromising\ninsistence upon acting simply as good citizens, as good Americans,\nwithout regard to fancied--and improper--class interests. Such an\nattitude is an object-lesson in good citizenship to the entire nation.But the extreme reactionaries, the persons who blind themselves to the\nwrongs now and then committed by the courts on laboring men, should\nalso think seriously as to what such a movement as this portends. The\njudges who have shown themselves able and willing effectively to check\nthe dishonest activity of the very rich man who works iniquity by the\nmismanagement of corporations, who have shown themselves alert to do\njustice to the wageworker, and sympathetic with the needs of the mass\nof our people, so that the dweller in the tenement houses, the man who\npractices a dangerous trade, the man who is crushed by excessive hours\nof labor, feel that their needs are understood by the courts--these\njudges are the real bulwark of the courts; these judges, the judges of\nthe stamp of the president-elect, who have been fearless in opposing\nlabor when it has gone wrong, but fearless also in holding to strict\naccount corporations that work iniquity, and far-sighted in seeing that\nthe workingman gets his rights, are the men of all others to whom we\nowe it that the appeal for such violent and mistaken legislation has\nfallen on deaf ears, that the agitation for its passage proved to be\nwithout substantial basis. The courts are jeopardized primarily by the\naction of those Federal and State judges who show inability or\nunwillingness to put a stop to the wrongdoing of very rich men under\nmodern industrial conditions, and inability or unwillingness to give\nrelief to men of small means or wageworkers who are crushed down by\nthese modern industrial conditions; who, in other words, fail to\nunderstand and apply the needed remedies for the new wrongs produced by\nthe new and highly complex social and industrial civilization which has\ngrown up in the last half century.The rapid changes in our social and industrial life which have attended\nthis rapid growth have made it necessary that, in applying to concrete\ncases the great rule of right laid down in our Constitution, there\nshould be a full understanding and appreciation of the new conditions\nto which the rules are to be applied. What would have been an\ninfringement upon liberty half a century ago may be the necessary\nsafeguard of liberty to-day. What would have been an injury to property\nthen may be necessary to the enjoyment of property now. Every judicial\ndecision involves two terms--one, as interpretation of the law; the\nother, the understanding of the facts to which it is to be applied. The\ngreat mass of our judicial officers are, I believe, alive to those\nchanges of conditions which so materially affect the performance of\ntheir judicial duties. Our judicial system is sound and effective at\ncore, and it remains, and must ever be maintained, as the safeguard of\nthose principles of liberty and justice which stand at the foundation\nof American institutions; for, as Burke finely said, when liberty and\njustice are separated, neither is safe. There are, however, some\nmembers of the judicial body who have lagged behind in their\nunderstanding of these great and vital changes in the body politic,\nwhose minds have never been opened to the new applications of the old\nprinciples made necessary by the new conditions. Judges of this stamp\ndo lasting harm by their decisions, because they convince poor men in\nneed of protection that the courts of the land are profoundly ignorant\nof and out of sympathy with their needs, and profoundly indifferent or\nhostile to any proposed remedy. To such men it seems a cruel mockery to\nhave any court decide against them on the ground that it desires to\npreserve \"liberty\" in a purely technical form, by withholding liberty\nin any real and constructive sense. It is desirable that the\nlegislative body should possess, and wherever necessary exercise, the\npower to determine whether in a given case employers and employees are\nnot on an equal footing, so that the necessities of the latter compel\nthem to submit to such exactions as to hours and conditions of labor as\nunduly to tax their strength; and only mischief can result when such\ndetermination is upset on the ground that there must be no\n\"interference with the liberty to contract\"--often a merely academic\n\"liberty,\" the exercise of which is the negation of real liberty.There are certain decisions by various courts which have been\nexceedingly detrimental to the rights of wageworkers. This is true of\nall the decisions that decide that men and women are, by the\nConstitution, \"guaranteed their liberty\" to contract to enter a\ndangerous occupation, or to work an undesirable or improper number of\nhours, or to work in unhealthy surroundings; and therefore can not\nrecover damages when maimed in that occupation and can not be forbidden\nto work what the legislature decides is an excessive number of hours,\nor to carry on the work under conditions which the legislature decides\nto be unhealthy. The most dangerous occupations are often the poorest\npaid and those where the hours of work are longest; and in many cases\nthose who go into them are driven by necessity so great that they have\npractically no alternative. Decisions such as those alluded to above\nnullify the legislative effort to protect the wage-workers who most\nneed protection from those employers who take advantage of their\ngrinding need. They halt or hamper the movement for securing better and\nmore equitable conditions of labor. The talk about preserving to the\nmisery-hunted beings who make contracts for such service their\n\"liberty\" to make them, is either to speak in a spirit of heartless\nirony or else to show an utter lack of knowledge of the conditions of\nlife among the great masses of our fellow-countrymen, a lack which\nunfits a judge to do good service just as it would unfit any executive\nor legislative officer.There is also, I think, ground for the belief that substantial\ninjustice is often suffered by employees in consequence of the custom\nof courts issuing temporary injunctions without notice to them, and\npunishing them for contempt of court in instances where, as a matter of\nfact, they have no knowledge of any proceedings. Outside of organized\nlabor there is a widespread feeling that this system often works great\ninjustice to wageworkers when their efforts to better their working\ncondition result in industrial disputes. A temporary injunction\nprocured ex parte may as a matter of fact have all the effect of a\npermanent injunction in causing disaster to the wageworkers' side in\nsuch a dispute. Organized labor is chafing under the unjust restraint\nwhich comes from repeated resort to this plan of procedure. Its\ndiscontent has been unwisely expressed, and often improperly expressed,\nbut there is a sound basis for it, and the orderly and law-abiding\npeople of a community would be in a far stronger position for upholding\nthe courts if the undoubtedly existing abuses could be provided\nagainst.Such proposals as those mentioned above as advocated by the extreme\nlabor leaders contain the vital error of being class legislation of the\nmost offensive kind, and even if enacted into law I believe that the\nlaw would rightly be held unconstitutional. Moreover, the labor people\nare themselves now beginning to invoke the use of the power of\ninjunction. During the last ten years, and within my own knowledge, at\nleast fifty injunctions have been obtained by labor unions in New York\nCity alone, most of them being to protect the union label (a \"property\nright\"), but some being obtained for other reasons against employers.\nThe power of injunction is a great equitable remedy, which should on no\naccount be destroyed. But safeguards should be erected against its\nabuse. I believe that some such provisions as those I advocated a year\nago for checking the abuse of the issuance of temporary injunctions\nshould be adopted. In substance, provision should be made that no\ninjunction or temporary restraining order issue otherwise than on\nnotice, except where irreparable injury would otherwise result; and in\nsuch case a hearing on the merits of the order should be had within a\nshort fixed period, and, if not then continued after hearing, it should\nforthwith lapse. Decisions should be rendered immediately, and the\nchance of delay minimized in every way. Moreover, I believe that the\nprocedure should be sharply defined, and the judge required minutely to\nstate the particulars both of his action and of his reasons therefor,\nso that the Congress can, if it desires, examine and investigate the\nsame.The chief lawmakers in our country may be, and often are, the judges,\nbecause they are the final seat of authority. Every time they interpret\ncontract, property, vested rights, due process of law, liberty, they\nnecessarily enact into law parts of a system of social philosophy, and\nas such interpretation is fundamental, they give direction to all\nlaw-making. The decisions of the courts on economic and social\nquestions depend upon their economic and social philosophy; and for the\npeaceful progress of our people during the twentieth century we shall\nowe most to those judges who hold to a twentieth century economic and\nsocial philosophy and not to a long outgrown philosophy, which was\nitself the product of primitive economic conditions. Of course a\njudge's views on progressive social philosophy are entirely second in\nimportance to his possession of a high and fine character; which means\nthe possession of such elementary virtues as honesty, courage, and\nfair-mindedness. The judge who owes his election to pandering to\ndemagogic sentiments or class hatreds and prejudices, and the judge who\nowes either his election or his appointment to the money or the favor\nof a great corporation, are alike unworthy to sit on the bench, are\nalike traitors to the people; and no profundity of legal learning, or\ncorrectness of abstract conviction on questions of public policy, can\nserve as an offset to such shortcomings. But it is also true that\njudges, like executives and legislators, should hold sound views on the\nquestions of public policy which are of vital interest to the people.The legislators and executives are chosen to represent the people in\nenacting and administering the laws. The judges are not chosen to\nrepresent the people in this sense. Their function is to interpret the\nlaws. The legislators are responsible for the laws; the judges for the\nspirit in which they interpret and enforce the laws. We stand aloof\nfrom the reckless agitators who would make the judges mere pliant tools\nof popular prejudice and passion; and we stand aloof from those equally\nunwise partisans of reaction and privilege who deny the proposition\nthat, inasmuch as judges are chosen to serve the interests of the whole\npeople, they should strive to find out what those interests are, and,\nso far as they conscientiously can, should strive to give effect to\npopular conviction when deliberately and duly expressed by the\nlawmaking body. The courts are to be highly commended and staunchly\nupheld when they set their faces against wrongdoing or tyranny by a\nmajority; but they are to be blamed when they fail to recognize under a\ngovernment like ours the deliberate judgment of the majority as to a\nmatter of legitimate policy, when duly expressed by the legislature.\nSuch lawfully expressed and deliberate judgment should be given effect\nby the courts, save in the extreme and exceptional cases where there\nhas been a clear violation of a constitutional provision. Anything like\nfrivolity or wantonness in upsetting such clearly taken governmental\naction is a grave offense against the Republic. To protest against\ntyranny, to protect minorities from oppression, to nullify an act\ncommitted in a spasm of popular fury, is to render a service to the\nRepublic. But for the courts to arrogate to themselves functions which\nproperly belong to the legislative bodies is all wrong, and in the end\nworks mischief. The people should not be permitted to pardon evil and\nslipshod legislation on the theory that the court will set it right;\nthey should be taught that the right way to get rid of a bad law is to\nhave the legislature repeal it, and not to have the courts by ingenious\nhair-splitting nullify it. A law may be unwise and improper; but it\nshould not for these reasons be declared unconstitutional by a strained\ninterpretation, for the result of such action is to take away from the\npeople at large their sense of responsibility and ultimately to destroy\ntheir capacity for orderly self restraint and self government. Under\nsuch a popular government as ours, rounded on the theory that in the\nlong run the will of the people is supreme, the ultimate safety of the\nNation can only rest in training and guiding the people so that what\nthey will shall be right, and not in devising means to defeat their\nwill by the technicalities of strained construction.For many of the shortcomings of justice in our country our people as a\nwhole are themselves to blame, and the judges and juries merely bear\ntheir share together with the public as a whole. It is discreditable to\nus as a people that there should be difficulty in convicting murderers,\nor in bringing to justice men who as public servants have been guilty\nof corruption, or who have profited by the corruption of public\nservants. The result is equally unfortunate, whether due to\nhairsplitting technicalities in the interpretation of law by judges, to\nsentimentality and class consciousness on the part of juries, or to\nhysteria and sensationalism in the daily press. For much of this\nfailure of justice no responsibility whatever lies on rich men as such.\nWe who make up the mass of the people can not shift the responsibility\nfrom our own shoulders. But there is an important part of the failure\nwhich has specially to do with inability to hold to proper account men\nof wealth who behave badly.The chief breakdown is in dealing with the new relations that arise\nfrom the mutualism, the interdependence of our time. Every new social\nrelation begets a new type of wrongdoing--of sin, to use an\nold-fashioned word--and many years always elapse before society is able\nto turn this sin into crime which can be effectively punished at law.\nDuring the lifetime of the older men now alive the social relations\nhave changed far more rapidly than in the preceding two centuries. The\nimmense growth of corporations, of business done by associations, and\nthe extreme strain and pressure of modern life, have produced\nconditions which render the public confused as to who its really\ndangerous foes are; and among the public servants who have not only\nshared this confusion, but by some of their acts have increased it, are\ncertain judges. Marked inefficiency has been shown in dealing with\ncorporations and in re-settling the proper attitude to be taken by the\npublic not only towards corporations, but towards labor and towards the\nsocial questions arising out of the factory system and the enormous\ngrowth of our great cities.The huge wealth that has been accumulated by a few individuals of\nrecent years, in what has amounted to a social and industrial\nrevolution, has been as regards some of these individuals made possible\nonly by the improper use of the modern corporation. A certain type of\nmodern corporation, with its officers and agents, its many issues of\nsecurities, and its constant consolidation with allied undertakings,\nfinally becomes an instrument so complex as to contain a greater number\nof elements that, under various judicial decisions, lend themselves to\nfraud and oppression than any device yet evolved in the human brain.\nCorporations are necessary instruments of modern business. They have\nbeen permitted to become a menace largely because the governmental\nrepresentatives of the people have worked slowly in providing for\nadequate control over them.The chief offender in any given case may be an executive, a\nlegislature, or a judge. Every executive head who advises violent,\ninstead of gradual, action, or who advocates ill-considered and\nsweeping measures of reform (especially if they are tainted with\nvindictiveness and disregard for the rights of the minority) is\nparticularly blameworthy. The several legislatures are responsible for\nthe fact that our laws are often prepared with slovenly haste and lack\nof consideration. Moreover, they are often prepared, and still more\nfrequently amended during passage, at the suggestion of the very\nparties against whom they are afterwards enforced. Our great clusters\nof corporations, huge trusts and fabulously wealthy multi-millionaires,\nemploy the very best lawyers they can obtain to pick flaws in these\nstatutes after their passage; but they also employ a class of secret\nagents who seek, under the advice of experts, to render hostile\nlegislation innocuous by making it unconstitutional, often through the\ninsertion of what appear on their face to be drastic and sweeping\nprovisions against the interests of the parties inspiring them; while\nthe demagogues, the corrupt creatures who introduce blackmailing\nschemes to \"strike\" corporations, and all who demand extreme, and\nundesirably radical, measures, show themselves to be the worst enemies\nof the very public whose loud-mouthed champions they profess to be. A\nvery striking illustration of the consequences of carelessness in the\npreparation of a statute was the employers' liability law of 1906. In\nthe cases arising under that law, four out of six courts of first\ninstance held it unconstitutional; six out of nine justices of the\nSupreme Court held that its subject-matter was within the province of\ncongressional action; and four of the nine justices held it valid. It\nwas, however, adjudged unconstitutional by a bare majority of the\ncourt--five to four. It was surely a very slovenly piece of work to\nframe the legislation in such shape as to leave the question open at\nall.Real damage has been done by the manifold and conflicting\ninterpretations of the interstate commerce law. Control over the great\ncorporations doing interstate business can be effective only if it is\nvested with full power in an administrative department, a branch of the\nFederal executive, carrying out a Federal law; it can never be\neffective if a divided responsibility is left in both the States and\nthe Nation; it can never be effective if left in the hands of the\ncourts to be decided by lawsuits.The courts hold a place of peculiar and deserved sanctity under our\nform of government. Respect for the law is essential to the permanence\nof our institutions; and respect for the law is largely conditioned\nupon respect for the courts. It is an offense against the Republic to\nsay anything which can weaken this respect, save for the gravest reason\nand in the most carefully guarded manner. Our judges should be held in\npeculiar honor; and the duty of respectful and truthful comment and\ncriticism, which should be binding when we speak of anybody, should be\nespecially binding when we speak of them. On an average they stand\nabove any other servants of the community, and the greatest judges have\nreached the high level held by those few greatest patriots whom the\nwhole country delights to honor. But we must face the fact that there\nare wise and unwise judges, just as there are wise and unwise\nexecutives and legislators. When a president or a governor behaves\nimproperly or unwisely, the remedy is easy, for his term is short; the\nsame is true with the legislator, although not to the same degree, for\nhe is one of many who belong to some given legislative body, and it is\ntherefore less easy to fix his personal responsibility and hold him\naccountable therefor. With a judge, who, being human, is also likely to\nerr, but whose tenure is for life, there is no similar way of holding\nhim to responsibility. Under ordinary conditions the only forms of\npressure to which he is in any way amenable are public opinion and the\naction of his fellow judges. It is the last which is most immediately\neffective, and to which we should look for the reform of abuses. Any\nremedy applied from without is fraught with risk. It is far better,\nfrom every standpoint, that the remedy should come from within. In no\nother nation in the world do the courts wield such vast and\nfar-reaching power as in the United States. All that is necessary is\nthat the courts as a whole should exercise this power with the\nfarsighted wisdom already shown by those judges who scan the future\nwhile they act in the present. Let them exercise this great power not\nonly honestly and bravely, but with wise insight into the needs and\nfixed purposes of the people, so that they may do justice and work\nequity, so that they may protect all persons in their rights, and yet\nbreak down the barriers of privilege, which is the foe of right.FORESTS.If there is any one duty which more than another we owe it to our\nchildren and our children's children to perform at once, it is to save\nthe forests of this country, for they constitute the first and most\nimportant element in the conservation of the natural resources of the\ncountry. There are of course two kinds of natural resources, One is the\nkind which can only be used as part of a process of exhaustion; this is\ntrue of mines, natural oil and gas wells, and the like. The other, and\nof course ultimately by far the most important, includes the resources\nwhich can be improved in the process of wise use; the soil, the rivers,\nand the forests come under this head. Any really civilized nation will\nso use all of these three great national assets that the nation will\nhave their benefit in the future. Just as a farmer, after all his life\nmaking his living from his farm, will, if he is an expert farmer, leave\nit as an asset of increased value to his son, so we should leave our\nnational domain to our children, increased in value and not worn out.\nThere are small sections of our own country, in the East and the West,\nin the Adriondacks, the White Mountains, and the Appalachians, and in\nthe Rocky Mountains, where we can already see for ourselves the damage\nin the shape of permanent injury to the soil and the river systems\nwhich comes from reckless deforestation. It matters not whether this\ndeforestation is due to the actual reckless cutting of timber, to the\nfires that inevitably follow such reckless cutting of timber, or to\nreckless and uncontrolled grazing, especially by the great migratory\nbands of sheep, the unchecked wandering of which over the country means\ndestruction to forests and disaster to the small home makers, the\nsettlers of limited means.Shortsighted persons, or persons blinded to the future by desire to\nmake money in every way out of the present, sometimes speak as if no\ngreat damage would be done by the reckless destruction of our forests.\nIt is difficult to have patience with the arguments of these persons.\nThanks to our own recklessness in the use of our splendid forests, we\nhave already crossed the verge of a timber famine in this country, and\nno measures that we now take can, at least for many years, undo the\nmischief that has already been done. But we can prevent further\nmischief being done; and it would be in the highest degree\nreprehensible to let any consideration of temporary convenience or\ntemporary cost interfere with such action, especially as regards the\nNational Forests which the nation can now, at this very moment,\ncontrol.All serious students of the question are aware of the great damage that\nhas been done in the Mediterranean countries of Europe, Asia, and\nAfrica by deforestation. The similar damage that has been done in\nEastern Asia is less well known. A recent investigation into conditions\nin North China by Mr. Frank N. Meyer, of the Bureau of Plant Industry\nof the United States Department of Agriculture, has incidentally\nfurnished in very striking fashion proof of the ruin that comes from\nreckless deforestation of mountains, and of the further fact that the\ndamage once done may prove practically irreparable. So important are\nthese investigations that I herewith attach as an appendix to my\nmessage certain photographs showing present conditions in China. They\nshow in vivid fashion the appalling desolation, taking the shape of\nbarren mountains and gravel and sand-covered plains, which immediately\nfollows and depends upon the deforestation of the mountains. Not many\ncenturies ago the country of northern China was one of the most fertile\nand beautiful spots in the entire world, and was heavily forested. We\nknow this not only from the old Chinese records, but from the accounts\ngiven by the traveler, Marco Polo. He, for instance, mentions that in\nvisiting the provinces of Shansi and Shensi he observed many\nplantations of mulberry trees. Now there is hardly a single mulberry\ntree in either of these provinces, and the culture of the silkworm has\nmoved farther south, to regions of atmospheric moisture. As an\nillustration of the complete change in the rivers, we may take Polo's\nstatement that a certain river, the Hun Ho, was so large and deep that\nmerchants ascended it from the sea with heavily laden boats; today this\nriver is simply a broad sandy bed, with shallow, rapid currents\nwandering hither and thither across it, absolutely unnavigable. But we\ndo not have to depend upon written records. The dry wells, and the\nwells with water far below the former watermark, bear testimony to the\ngood days of the past and the evil days of the present. Wherever the\nnative vegetation has been allowed to remain, as, for instance, here\nand there around a sacred temple or imperial burying ground, there are\nstill huge trees and tangled jungle, fragments of the glorious ancient\nforests. The thick, matted forest growth formerly covered the mountains\nto their summits. All natural factors favored this dense forest growth,\nand as long as it was permitted to exist the plains at the foot of the\nmountains were among the most fertile on the globe, and the whole\ncountry was a garden. Not the slightest effort was made, however, to\nprevent the unchecked cutting of the trees, or to secure reforestation.\nDoubtless for many centuries the tree-cutting by the inhabitants of the\nmountains worked but slowly in bringing about the changes that have now\ncome to pass; doubtless for generations the inroads were scarcely\nnoticeable. But there came a time when the forest had shrunk\nsufficiently to make each year's cutting a serious matter, and from\nthat time on the destruction proceeded with appalling rapidity; for of\ncourse each year of destruction rendered the forest less able to\nrecuperate, less able to resist next year's inroad. Mr. Meyer describes\nthe ceaseless progress of the destruction even now, when there is so\nlittle left to destroy. Every morning men and boys go out armed with\nmattox or axe, scale the steepest mountain sides, and cut down and grub\nout, root and branch, the small trees and shrubs still to be found. The\nbig trees disappeared centuries ago, so that now one of these is never\nseen save in the neighborhood of temples, where they are artificially\nprotected; and even here it takes all the watch and care of the\ntree-loving priests to prevent their destruction. Each family, each\ncommunity, where there is no common care exercised in the interest of\nall of them to prevent deforestation, finds its profit in the immediate\nuse of the fuel which would otherwise be used by some other family or\nsome other community. In the total absence of regulation of the matter\nin the interest of the whole people, each small group is inevitably\npushed into a policy of destruction which can not afford to take\nthought for the morrow. This is just one of those matters which it is\nfatal to leave to unsupervised individual control. The forest can only\nbe protected by the State, by the Nation; and the liberty of action of\nindividuals must be conditioned upon what the State or Nation\ndetermines to be necessary for the common safety.The lesson of deforestation in China is a lesson which mankind should\nhave learned many times already from what has occurred in other places.\nDenudation leaves naked soil; then gullying cuts down to the bare rock;\nand meanwhile the rock-waste buries the bottomlands. When the soil is\ngone, men must go; and the process does not take long.This ruthless destruction of the forests in northern China has brought\nabout, or has aided in bringing about, desolation, just as the\ndestruction of the forests in central Asia aid in bringing ruin to the\nonce rich central Asian cities; just as the destruction of the forest\nin northern Africa helped towards the ruin of a region that was a\nfertile granary in Roman days. Shortsighted man, whether barbaric,\nsemi-civilized, or what he mistakenly regards as fully civilized, when\nhe has destroyed the forests, has rendered certain the ultimate\ndestruction of the land itself. In northern China the mountains are now\nsuch as are shown by the accompanying photographs, absolutely barren\npeaks. Not only have the forests been destroyed, but because of their\ndestruction the soil has been washed off the naked rock. The terrible\nconsequence is that it is impossible now to undo the damage that has\nbeen done. Many centuries would have to pass before soil would again\ncollect, or could be made to collect, in sufficient quantity once more\nto support the old-time forest growth. In consequence the Mongol Desert\nis practically extending eastward over northern China. The climate has\nchanged and is still changing. It has changed even within the last half\ncentury, as the work of tree destruction has been consummated. The\ngreat masses of arboreal vegetation on the mountains formerly absorbed\nthe heat of the sun and sent up currents of cool air which brought the\nmoisture-laden clouds lower and forced them to precipitate in rain a\npart of their burden of water. Now that there is no vegetation, the\nbarren mountains, scorched by the sun, send up currents of heated air\nwhich drive away instead of attracting the rain clouds, and cause their\nmoisture to be disseminated. In consequence, instead of the regular and\nplentiful rains which existed in these regions of China when the\nforests were still in evidence, the unfortunate inhabitants of the\ndeforested lands now see their crops wither for lack of rainfall, while\nthe seasons grow more and more irregular; and as the air becomes dryer\ncertain crops refuse longer to grow at all. That everything dries out\nfaster than formerly is shown by the fact that the level of the wells\nall over the land has sunk perceptibly, many of them having become\ntotally dry. In addition to the resulting agricultural distress, the\nwatercourses have changed. Formerly they were narrow and deep, with an\nabundance of clear water the year around; for the roots and humus of\nthe forests caught the rainwater and let it escape by slow, regular\nseepage. They have now become broad, shallow stream beds, in which\nmuddy water trickles in slender currents during the dry seasons, while\nwhen it rains there are freshets, and roaring muddy torrents come\ntearing down, bringing disaster and destruction everywhere. Moreover,\nthese floods and freshets, which diversify the general dryness, wash\naway from the mountain sides, and either wash away or cover in the\nvalleys, the rich fertile soil which it took tens of thousands of years\nfor Nature to form; and it is lost forever, and until the forests grow\nagain it can not be replaced. The sand and stones from the mountain\nsides are washed loose and come rolling down to cover the arable lands,\nand in consequence, throughout this part of China, many formerly rich\ndistricts are now sandy wastes, useless for human cultivation and even\nfor pasture. The cities have been of course seriously affected, for the\nstreams have gradually ceased to be navigable. There is testimony that\neven within the memory of men now living there has been a serious\ndiminution of the rainfall of northeastern China. The level of the\nSungari River in northern Manchuria has been sensibly lowered during\nthe last fifty years, at least partly as the result of the\nindiscriminate rutting of the forests forming its watershed. Almost all\nthe rivers of northern China have become uncontrollable, and very\ndangerous to the dwellers along their banks, as a direct result of the\ndestruction of the forests. The journey from Pekin to Jehol shows in\nmelancholy fashion how the soil has been washed away from whole\nvalleys, so that they have been converted into deserts.In northern China this disastrous process has gone on so long and has\nproceeded so far that no complete remedy could be applied. There are\ncertain mountains in China from which the soil is gone so utterly that\nonly the slow action of the ages could again restore it; although of\ncourse much could be done to prevent the still further eastward\nextension of the Mongolian Desert if the Chinese Government would act\nat once. The accompanying cuts from photographs show the inconceivable\ndesolation of the barren mountains in which certain of these rivers\nrise--mountains, be it remembered, which formerly supported dense\nforests of larches and firs, now unable to produce any wood, and\nbecause of their condition a source of danger to the whole country. The\nphotographs also show the same rivers after they have passed through\nthe mountains, the beds having become broad and sandy because of the\ndeforestation of the mountains. One of the photographs shows a caravan\npassing through a valley. Formerly, when the mountains were forested,\nit was thickly peopled by prosperous peasants. Now the floods have\ncarried destruction all over the land and the valley is a stony desert.\nAnother photograph shows a mountain road covered with the stones and\nrocks that are brought down in the rainy season from the mountains\nwhich have already been deforested by human hands. Another shows a\npebbly river-bed in southern Manchuria where what was once a great\nstream has dried up owing to the deforestation in the mountains. Only\nsome scrub wood is left, which will disappear within a half century.\nYet another shows the effect of one of the washouts, destroying an\narable mountain side, these washouts being due to the removal of all\nvegetation; yet in this photograph the foreground shows that\nreforestation is still a possibility in places.What has thus happened in northern China, what has happened in Central\nAsia, in Palestine, in North Africa, in parts of the Mediterranean\ncountries of Europe, will surely happen in our country if we do not\nexercise that wise forethought which should be one of the chief marks\nof any people calling itself civilized. Nothing should be permitted to\nstand in the way of the preservation of the forests, and it is criminal\nto permit individuals to purchase a little gain for themselves through\nthe destruction of forests when this destruction is fatal to the\nwell-being of the whole country in the future.INLAND WATERWAYS.Action should be begun forthwith, during the present session of the\nCongress, for the improvement of our inland waterways--action which\nwill result in giving us not only navigable but navigated rivers. We\nhave spent hundreds of millions of dollars upon these waterways, yet\nthe traffic on nearly all of them is steadily declining. This condition\nis the direct result of the absence of any comprehensive and far-seeing\nplan of waterway improvement, Obviously we can not continue thus to\nexpend the revenues of the Government without return. It is poor\nbusiness to spend money for inland navigation unless we get it.Inquiry into the condition of the Mississippi and its principal\ntributaries reveals very many instances of the utter waste caused by\nthe methods which have hitherto obtained for the so-called\n\"improvement\" of navigation. A striking instance is supplied by the\n\"improvement\" of the Ohio, which, begun in 1824, was continued under a\nsingle plan for half a century. In 1875 a new plan was adopted and\nfollowed for a quarter of a century. In 1902 still a different plan was\nadopted and has since been pursued at a rate which only promises a\nnavigable river in from twenty to one hundred years longer.Such shortsighted, vacillating, and futile methods are accompanied by\ndecreasing water-borne commerce and increasing traffic congestion on\nland, by increasing floods, and by the waste of public money. The\nremedy lies in abandoning the methods which have so signally failed and\nadopting new ones in keeping with the needs and demands of our people.In a report on a measure introduced at the first session of the present\nCongress, the Secretary of War said: \"The chief defect in the methods\nhitherto pursued lies in the absence of executive authority for\noriginating comprehensive plans covering the country or natural\ndivisions thereof.\" In this opinion I heartily concur. The present\nmethods not only fail to give us inland navigation, but they are\ninjurious to the army as well. What is virtually a permanent detail of\nthe corps of engineers to civilian duty necessarily impairs the\nefficiency of our military establishment. The military engineers have\nundoubtedly done efficient work in actual construction, but they are\nnecessarily unsuited by their training and traditions to take the broad\nview, and to gather and transmit to the Congress the commercial and\nindustrial information and forecasts, upon which waterway improvement\nmust always so largely rest. Furthermore, they have failed to grasp the\ngreat underlying fact that every stream is a unit from its source to\nits mouth, and that all its uses are interdependent. Prominent officers\nof the Engineer Corps have recently even gone so far as to assert in\nprint that waterways are not dependent upon the conservation of the\nforests about their headwaters. This position is opposed to all the\nrecent work of the scientific bureaus of the Government and to the\ngeneral experience of mankind. A physician who disbelieved in\nvaccination would not be the right man to handle an epidemic of\nsmallpox, nor should we leave a doctor skeptical about the transmission\nof yellow fever by the Stegomyia mosquito in charge of sanitation at\nHavana or Panama. So with the improvement of our rivers; it is no\nlonger wise or safe to leave this great work in the hands of men who\nfail to grasp the essential relations between navigation and general\ndevelopment and to assimilate and use the central facts about our\nstreams.Until the work of river improvement is undertaken in a modern way it\ncan not have results that will meet the needs of this modern nation.\nThese needs should be met without further dilly-dallying or delay. The\nplan which promises the best and quickest results is that of a\npermanent commission authorized to coordinate the work of all the\nGovernment departments relating to waterways, and to frame and\nsupervise the execution of a comprehensive plan. Under such a\ncommission the actual work of construction might be entrusted to the\nreclamation service; or to the military engineers acting with a\nsufficient number of civilians to continue the work in time of war; or\nit might be divided between the reclamation service and the corps of\nengineers. Funds should be provided from current revenues if it is\ndeemed wise--otherwise from the sale of bonds. The essential thing is\nthat the work should go forward under the best possible plan, and with\nthe least possible delay. We should have a new type of work and a new\norganization for planning and directing it. The time for playing with\nour waterways is past. The country demands results.NATIONAL PARKS.I urge that all our National parks adjacent to National forests be\nplaced completely under the control of the forest service of the\nAgricultural Department, instead of leaving them as they now are, under\nthe Interior Department and policed by the army. The Congress should\nprovide for superintendents with adequate corps of first-class civilian\nscouts, or rangers, and, further, place the road construction under the\nsuperintendent instead of leaving it with the War Department. Such a\nchange in park management would result in economy and avoid the\ndifficulties of administration which now arise from having the\nresponsibility of care and protection divided between different\ndepartments. The need for this course is peculiarly great in the\nYellowstone Park. This, like the Yosemite, is a great wonderland, and\nshould be kept as a national playground. In both, all wild things\nshould be protected and the scenery kept wholly unmarred.I am happy to say that I have been able to set aside in various parts\nof the country small, well-chosen tracts of ground to serve as\nsanctuaries and nurseries for wild creatures.DENATURED ALCOHOL.I had occasion in my message of May 4, 1906, to urge the passage of\nsome law putting alcohol, used in the arts, industries, and\nmanufactures, upon the free list--that is, to provide for the\nwithdrawal free of tax of alcohol which is to be denatured for those\npurposes. The law of June 7, 1906, and its amendment of March 2, 1907,\naccomplished what was desired in that respect, and the use of denatured\nalcohol, as intended, is making a fair degree of progress and is\nentitled to further encouragement and support from the Congress.PURE FOOD.The pure food legislation has already worked a benefit difficult to\noverestimate.INDIAN SERVICE.It has been my purpose from the beginning of my administration to take\nthe Indian Service completely out of the atmosphere of political\nactivity, and there has been steady progress toward that end. The last\nremaining stronghold of politics in that service was the agency system,\nwhich had seen its best days and was gradually falling to pieces from\nnatural or purely evolutionary causes, but, like all such survivals,\nwas decaying slowly in its later stages. It seems clear that its\nextinction had better be made final now, so that the ground can be\ncleared for larger constructive work on behalf of the Indians,\npreparatory to their induction into the full measure of responsible\ncitizenship. On November 1 only eighteen agencies were left on the\nroster; with two exceptions, where some legal questions seemed to stand\ntemporarily in the way, these have been changed to superintendencies,\nand their heads brought into the classified civil service.SECRET SERVICE.Last year an amendment was incorporated in the measure providing for\nthe Secret Service, which provided that there should be no detail from\nthe Secret Service and no transfer therefrom. It is not too much to say\nthat this amendment has been of benefit only, and could be of benefit\nonly, to the criminal classes. If deliberately introduced for the\npurpose of diminishing the effectiveness of war against crime it could\nnot have been better devised to this end. It forbade the practices that\nhad been followed to a greater or less extent by the executive heads of\nvarious departments for twenty years. To these practices we owe the\nsecuring of the evidence which enabled us to drive great lotteries out\nof business and secure a quarter of a million of dollars in fines from\ntheir promoters. These practices have enabled us to get some of the\nevidence indispensable in order in connection with the theft of\ngovernment land and government timber by great corporations and by\nindividuals. These practices have enabled us to get some of the\nevidence indispensable in order to secure the conviction of the\nwealthiest and most formidable criminals with whom the Government has\nto deal, both those operating in violation of the anti-trust law and\nothers. The amendment in question was of benefit to no one excepting to\nthese criminals, and it seriously hampers the Government in the\ndetection of crime and the securing of justice. Moreover, it not only\naffects departments outside of the Treasury, but it tends to hamper the\nSecretary of the Treasury himself in the effort to utilize the\nemployees of his department so as to best meet the requirements of the\npublic service. It forbids him from preventing frauds upon the customs\nservice, from investigating irregularities in branch mints and assay\noffices, and has seriously crippled him. It prevents the promotion of\nemployees in the Secret Service, and this further discourages good\neffort. In its present form the restriction operates only to the\nadvantage of the criminal, of the wrongdoer. The chief argument in\nfavor of the provision was that the Congressmen did not themselves wish\nto be investigated by Secret Service men. Very little of such\ninvestigation has been done in the past; but it is true that the work\nof the Secret Service agents was partly responsible for the indictment\nand conviction of a Senator and a Congressman for land frauds in\nOregon. I do not believe that it is in the public interest to protect\ncriminally in any branch of the public service, and exactly as we have\nagain and again during the past seven years prosecuted and convicted\nsuch criminals who were in the executive branch of the Government, so\nin my belief we should be given ample means to prosecute them if found\nin the legislative branch. But if this is not considered desirable a\nspecial exception could be made in the law prohibiting the use of the\nSecret Service force in investigating members of the Congress. It would\nbe far better to do this than to do what actually was done, and strive\nto prevent or at least to hamper effective action against criminals by\nthe executive branch of the Government.POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.I again renew my recommendation for postal savings hanks, for\ndepositing savings with the security of the Government behind them. The\nobject is to encourage thrift and economy in the wage-earner and person\nof moderate means. In 14 States the deposits in savings banks as\nreported to the Comptroller of the Currency amount to $3,590,245,402,\nor 98.4 per cent of the entire deposits, while in the remaining 32\nStates there are only $70,308,543, or 1.6 per cent, showing\nconclusively that there are many localities in the United States where\nsufficient opportunity is not given to the people to deposit their\nsavings. The result is that money is kept in hiding and unemployed. It\nis believed that in the aggregate vast sums of money would be brought\ninto circulation through the instrumentality of the postal savings\nbanks. While there are only 1,453 savings banks reporting to the\nComptroller there are more than 61,000 post-offices, 40,000 of which\nare money order offices. Postal savings banks are now in operation in\npractically all of the great civilized countries with the exception of\nthe United States.PARCEL POST.In my last annual message I commended the Postmaster-General's\nrecommendation for an extension of the parcel post on the rural routes.\nThe establishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would be to\nthe mutual benefit of the farmer and the country storekeeper, and it is\ndesirable that the routes, serving more than 15,000,000 people, should\nbe utilized to the fullest practicable extent. An amendment was\nproposed in the Senate at the last session, at the suggestion of the\nPostmaster-General, providing that, for the purpose of ascertaining the\npracticability of establishing a special local parcel post system on\nthe rural routes throughout the United States, the Postmaster-General\nbe authorized and directed to experiment and report to the Congress the\nresult of such experiment by establishing a special local parcel post\nsystem on rural delivery routes in not to exceed four counties in the\nUnited States for packages of fourth-class matter originating on a\nrural route or at the distributing post office for delivery by rural\ncarriers. It would seem only proper that such an experiment should be\ntried in order to demonstrate the practicability of the proposition,\nespecially as the Postmaster-General estimates that the revenue derived\nfrom the operation of such a system on all the rural routes would\namount to many million dollars.EDUCATION.The share that the National Government should take in the broad work of\neducation has not received the attention and the care it rightly\ndeserves. The immediate responsibility for the support and improvement\nof our educational systems and institutions rests and should always\nrest with the people of the several States acting through their state\nand local governments, but the Nation has an opportunity in educational\nwork which must not be lost and a duty which should no longer be\nneglected.The National Bureau of Education was established more than forty years\nago. Its purpose is to collect and diffuse such information \"as shall\naid the people of the United States in the establishment and\nmaintenance of efficient school systems and otherwise promote the cause\nof education throughout the country.\" This purpose in no way conflicts\nwith the educational work of the States, but may be made of great\nadvantage to the States by giving them the fullest, most accurate, and\nhence the most helpful information and suggestion regarding the best\neducational systems. The Nation, through its broader field of\nactivities, its wider opportunity for obtaining information from all\nthe States and from foreign countries, is able to do that which not\neven the richest States can do, and with the distinct additional\nadvantage that the information thus obtained is used for the immediate\nbenefit of all our people.With the limited means hitherto provided, the Bureau of Education has\nrendered efficient service, but the Congress has neglected to\nadequately supply the bureau with means to meet the educational growth\nof the country. The appropriations for the general work of the bureau,\noutside education in Alaska, for the year 1909 are but $87,500--an\namount less than they were ten years ago, and some of the important\nitems in these appropriations are less than they were thirty years ago.\nIt is an inexcusable waste of public money to appropriate an amount\nwhich is so inadequate as to make it impossible properly to do the work\nauthorized, and it is unfair to the great educational interests of the\ncountry to deprive them of the value of the results which can be\nobtained by proper appropriations.I earnestly recommend that this unfortunate state of affairs as regards\nthe national educational office be remedied by adequate appropriations.\nThis recommendation is urged by the representatives of our common\nschools and great state universities and the leading educators, who all\nunite in requesting favorable consideration and action by the Congress\nupon this subject.CENSUS.I strongly urge that the request of the Director of the Census in\nconnection with the decennial work so soon to be begun be complied with\nand that the appointments to the census force be placed under the civil\nservice law, waiving the geographical requirements as requested by the\nDirector of the Census. The supervisors and enumerators should not be\nappointed under the civil service law, for the reasons given by the\nDirector. I commend to the Congress the careful consideration of the\nadmirable report of the Director of the Census, and I trust that his\nrecommendations will be adopted and immediate action thereon taken.PUBLIC HEALTH.It is highly advisable that there should be intelligent action on the\npart of the Nation on the question of preserving the health of the\ncountry. Through the practical extermination in San Francisco of\ndisease-bearing rodents our country has thus far escaped the bubonic\nplague. This is but one of the many achievements of American health\nofficers; and it shows what can be accomplished with a better\norganization than at present exists. The dangers to public health from\nfood adulteration and from many other sources, such as the menace to\nthe physical, mental and moral development of children from child\nlabor, should be met and overcome. There are numerous diseases, which\nare now known to be preventable, which are, nevertheless, not\nprevented. The recent International Congress on Tuberculosis has made\nus painfully aware of the inadequacy of American public health\nlegislation. This Nation can not afford to lag behind in the world-wide\nbattle now being waged by all civilized people with the microscopic\nfoes of mankind, nor ought we longer to ignore the reproach that this\nGovernment takes more pains to protect the lives of hogs and of cattle\nthan of human beings.REDISTRIBUTION OF BUREAUS.The first legislative step to be taken is that for the concentration of\nthe proper bureaus into one of the existing departments. I therefore\nurgently recommend the passage of a bill which shall authorize a\nredistribution of the bureaus which shall best accomplish this end.GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE.I recommend that legislation be enacted placing under the jurisdiction\nof the Department of Commerce and Labor the Government Printing Office.\nAt present this office is under the combined control, supervision, and\nadministrative direction of the President and of the Joint Committee on\nPrinting of the two Houses of the Congress. The advantage of having the\n4,069 employees in this office and the expenditure of the $5,761,377.57\nappropriated therefor supervised by an executive department is obvious,\ninstead of the present combined supervision.SOLDIERS' HOMES.All Soldiers' Homes should be placed under the complete jurisdiction\nand control of the War Department.INDEPENDENT BUREAUS AND COMMISSIONS.Economy and sound business policy require that all existing independent\nbureaus and commissions should be placed under the jurisdiction of\nappropriate executive departments. It is unwise from every standpoint,\nand results only in mischief, to have any executive work done save by\nthe purely executive bodies, under the control of the President; and\neach such executive body should be under the immediate supervision of a\nCabinet Minister.STATEHOOD.I advocate the immediate admission of New Mexico and Arizona as States.\nThis should be done at the present session of the Congress. The people\nof the two Territories have made it evident by their votes that they\nwill not come in as one State. The only alternative is to admit them as\ntwo, and I trust that this will be done without delay.INTERSTATE FISHERIES.I call the attention of the Congress to the importance of the problem\nof the fisheries in the interstate waters. On the Great Lakes we are\nnow, under the very wise treaty of April 11th of this year, endeavoring\nto come to an international agreement for the preservation and\nsatisfactory use of the fisheries of these waters which can not\notherwise be achieved. Lake Erie, for example, has the richest fresh\nwater fisheries in the world; but it is now controlled by the statutes\nof two Nations, four States, and one Province, and in this Province by\ndifferent ordinances in different counties. All these political\ndivisions work at cross purposes, and in no case can they achieve\nprotection to the fisheries, on the one hand, and justice to the\nlocalities and individuals on the other. The case is similar in Puget\nSound.But the problem is quite as pressing in the interstate waters of the\nUnited States. The salmon fisheries of the Columbia River are now but a\nfraction of what they were twenty-five years ago, and what they would\nbe now if the United States Government had taken complete charge of\nthem by intervening between Oregon and Washington. During these\ntwenty-five years the fishermen of each State have naturally tried to\ntake all they could get, and the two legislatures have never been able\nto agree on joint action of any kind adequate in degree for the\nprotection of the fisheries. At the moment the fishing on the Oregon\nside is practically closed, while there is no limit on the Washington\nside of any kind, and no one can tell what the courts will decide as to\nthe very statutes under which this action and non-action result.\nMeanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four\nyears hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a\nstruggle between the associated, or gill-net, fishermen on the one\nhand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river. The fisheries\nof the Mississippi, the Ohio, and the Potomac are also in a bad way.\nFor this there is no remedy except for the United States to control and\nlegislate for the interstate fisheries as part of the business of\ninterstate commerce. In this case the machinery for scientific\ninvestigation and for control already exists in the United States\nBureau of Fisheries. In this as in similar problems the obvious and\nsimple rule should be followed of having those matters which no\nparticular State can manage taken in hand by the United States;\nproblems which in the seesaw of conflicting State legislatures are\nabsolutely unsolvable are easy enough for Congress to control.FISHERIES AND FUR SEALS.The federal statute regulating interstate traffic in game should be\nextended to include fish. New federal fish hatcheries should be\nestablished. The administration of the Alaskan fur-seal service should\nbe vested in the Bureau of Fisheries.FOREIGN AFFAIRS.This Nation's foreign policy is based on the theory that right must be\ndone between nations precisely as between individuals, and in our\nactions for the last ten years we have in this matter proven our faith\nby our deeds. We have behaved, and are behaving, towards other nations\nas in private life an honorable man would behave towards his fellows.LATIN-AMERICAN REPUBLICS.The commercial and material progress of the twenty Latin-American\nRepublics is worthy of the careful attention of the Congress. No other\nsection of the world has shown a greater proportionate development of\nits foreign trade during the last ten years and none other has more\nspecial claims on the interest of the United States. It offers to-day\nprobably larger opportunities for the legitimate expansion of our\ncommerce than any other group of countries. These countries will want\nour products in greatly increased quantities, and we shall\ncorrespondingly need theirs. The International Bureau of the American\nRepublics is doing a useful work in making these nations and their\nresources better known to us, and in acquainting them not only with us\nas a people and with our purposes towards them, but with what we have\nto exchange for their goods. It is an international institution\nsupported by all the governments of the two Americas.PANAMA CANAL.The work on the Panama Canal is being done with a speed, efficiency and\nentire devotion to duty which make it a model for all work of the kind.\nNo task of such magnitude has ever before been undertaken by any\nnation; and no task of the kind has ever been better performed. The men\non the isthmus, from Colonel Goethals and his fellow commissioners\nthrough the entire list of employees who are faithfully doing their\nduty, have won their right to the ungrudging respect and gratitude of\nthe American people.OCEAN MAIL LINERS.I again recommend the extension of the ocean mail act of 1891 so that\nsatisfactory American ocean mail lines to South America, Asia, the\nPhilippines, and Australasia may be established. The creation of such\nsteamship lines should be the natural corollary of the voyage of the\nbattle fleet. It should precede the opening of the Panama Canal. Even\nunder favorable conditions several years must elapse before such lines\ncan be put into operation. Accordingly I urge that the Congress act\npromptly where foresight already shows that action sooner or later will\nbe inevitable.HAWAII.I call particular attention to the Territory of Hawaii. The importance\nof those islands is apparent, and the need of improving their condition\nand developing their resources is urgent. In recent years industrial\nconditions upon the islands have radically changed, The importation of\ncoolie labor has practically ceased, and there is now developing such a\ndiversity in agricultural products as to make possible a change in the\nland conditions of the Territory, so that an opportunity may be given\nto the small land owner similar to that on the mainland. To aid these\nchanges, the National Government must provide the necessary harbor\nimprovements on each island, so that the agricultural products can be\ncarried to the markets of the world. The coastwise shipping laws should\nbe amended to meet the special needs of the islands, and the alien\ncontract labor law should be so modified in its application to Hawaii\nas to enable American and European labor to be brought thither.We have begun to improve Pearl Harbor for a naval base and to provide\nthe necessary military fortifications for the protection of the\nislands, but I can not too strongly emphasize the need of\nappropriations for these purposes of such an amount as will within the\nshortest possible time make those islands practically impregnable. It\nis useless to develop the industrial conditions of the islands and\nestablish there bases of supply for our naval and merchant fleets\nunless we insure, as far as human ingenuity can, their safety from\nforeign seizure.One thing to be remembered with all our fortifications is that it is\nalmost useless to make them impregnable from the sea if they are left\nopen to land attack. This is true even of our own coast, but it is\ndoubly true of our insular possessions. In Hawaii, for instance, it is\nworse than useless to establish a naval station unless we establish it\nbehind fortifications so strong that no landing force can take them\nsave by regular and long-continued siege operations.THE PHILIPPINES.Real progress toward self-government is being made in the Philippine\nIslands. The gathering of a Philippine legislative body and Philippine\nassembly marks a process absolutely new in Asia, not only as regards\nAsiatic colonies of European powers but as regards Asiatic possessions\nof other Asiatic powers; and, indeed, always excepting the striking and\nwonderful example afforded by the great Empire of Japan, it opens an\nentirely new departure when compared with anything which has happened\namong Asiatic powers which are their own masters. Hitherto this\nPhilippine legislature has acted with moderation and self-restraint,\nand has seemed in practical fashion to realize the eternal truth that\nthere must always be government, and that the only way in which any\nbody of individuals can escape the necessity of being governed by\noutsiders is to show that they are able to restrain themselves, to keep\ndown wrongdoing and disorder. The Filipino people, through their\nofficials, are therefore making real steps in the direction of\nself-government. I hope and believe that these steps mark the beginning\nof a course which will continue till the Filipinos become fit to decide\nfor themselves whether they desire to be an independent nation. But it\nis well for them (and well also for those Americans who during the past\ndecade have done so much damage to the Filipinos by agitation for an\nimmediate independence for which they were totally unfit) to remember\nthat self-government depends, and must depend, upon the Filipinos\nthemselves. All we can do is to give them the opportunity to develop\nthe capacity for self-government. If we had followed the advice of the\nfoolish doctrinaires who wished us at any time during the last ten\nyears to turn the Filipino people adrift, we should have shirked the\nplainest possible duty and have inflicted a lasting wrong upon the\nFilipino people. We have acted in exactly the opposite spirit. We have\ngiven the Filipinos constitutional government--a government based upon\njustice--and we have shown that we have governed them for their good\nand not for our aggrandizement. At the present time, as during the past\nten years, the inexorable logic of facts shows that this government\nmust be supplied by us and not by them. We must be wise and generous;\nwe must help the Filipinos to master the difficult art of self-control,\nwhich is simply another name for self-government. But we can not give\nthem self-government save in the sense of governing them so that\ngradually they may, if they are able, learn to govern themselves. Under\nthe present system of just laws and sympathetic administration, we have\nevery reason to believe that they are gradually acquiring the character\nwhich lies at the basis of self-government, and for which, if it be\nlacking, no system of laws, no paper constitution, will in any wise\nserve as a substitute. Our people in the Philippines have achieved what\nmay legitimately be called a marvelous success in giving to them a\ngovernment which marks on the part of those in authority both the\nnecessary understanding of the people and the necessary purpose to\nserve them disinterestedly and in good faith. I trust that within a\ngeneration the time will arrive when the Philippines can decide for\nthemselves whether it is well for them to become independent, or to\ncontinue under the protection of a strong and disinterested power, able\nto guarantee to the islands order at home and protection from foreign\ninvasion. But no one can prophesy the exact date when it will be wise\nto consider independence as a fixed and definite policy. It would be\nworse than folly to try to set down such a date in advance, for it must\ndepend upon the way in which the Philippine people themselves develop\nthe power of self-mastery.PORTO RICO.I again recommend that American citizenship be conferred upon the\npeople of Porto Rico.CUBA.In Cuba our occupancy will cease in about two months' time, the Cubans\nhave in orderly manner elected their own governmental authorities, and\nthe island will be turned over to them. Our occupation on this occasion\nhas lasted a little over two years, and Cuba has thriven and prospered\nunder it. Our earnest hope and one desire is that the people of the\nisland shall now govern themselves with justice, so that peace and\norder may be secure. We will gladly help them to this end; but I would\nsolemnly warn them to remember the great truth that the only way a\npeople can permanently avoid being governed from without is to show\nthat they both can and will govern themselves from within.JAPANESE EXPOSITION.The Japanese Government has postponed until 1917 the date of the great\ninternational exposition, the action being taken so as to insure ample\ntime in which to prepare to make the exposition all that it should be\nmade. The American commissioners have visited Japan and the\npostponement will merely give ampler opportunity for America to be\nrepresented at the exposition. Not since the first international\nexposition has there been one of greater importance than this will be,\nmarking as it does the fiftieth anniversary of the ascension to the\nthrone of the Emperor of Japan. The extraordinary leap to a foremost\nplace among the nations of the world made by Japan during this half\ncentury is something unparalleled in all previous history. This\nexposition will fitly commemorate and signalize the giant progress that\nhas been achieved. It is the first exposition of its kind that has ever\nbeen held in Asia. The United States, because of the ancient friendship\nbetween the two peoples, because each of us fronts on the Pacific, and\nbecause of the growing commercial relations between this country and\nAsia, takes a peculiar interest in seeing the exposition made a success\nin every way.I take this opportunity publicly to state my appreciation of the way in\nwhich in Japan, in Australia, in New Zealand, and in all the States of\nSouth America, the battle fleet has been received on its practice\nvoyage around the world. The American Government can not too strongly\nexpress its appreciation of the abounding and generous hospitality\nshown our ships in every port they visited.THE ARMY.As regards the Army I call attention to the fact that while our junior\nofficers and enlisted men stand very high, the present system of\npromotion by seniority results in bringing into the higher grades many\nmen of mediocre capacity who have but a short time to serve. No man\nshould regard it as his vested right to rise to the highest rank in the\nArmy any more than in any other profession. It is a curious and by no\nmeans creditable fact that there should be so often a failure on the\npart of the public and its representatives to understand the great\nneed, from the standpoint of the service and the Nation, of refusing to\npromote respectable, elderly incompetents. The higher places should be\ngiven to the most deserving men without regard to seniority; at least\nseniority should be treated as only one consideration. In the stress of\nmodern industrial competition no business firm could succeed if those\nresponsible for its management were chosen simply on the ground that\nthey were the oldest people in its employment; yet this is the course\nadvocated as regards the Army, and required by law for all grades\nexcept those of general officer. As a matter of fact, all of the best\nofficers in the highest ranks of the Army are those who have attained\ntheir present position wholly or in part by a process of selection.The scope of retiring boards should be extended so that they could\nconsider general unfitness to command for any cause, in order to secure\na far more rigid enforcement than at present in the elimination of\nofficers for mental, physical or temperamental disabilities. But this\nplan is recommended only if the Congress does not see fit to provide\nwhat in my judgment is far better; that is, for selection in promotion,\nand for elimination for age. Officers who fail to attain a certain rank\nby a certain age should be retired--for instance, if a man should not\nattain field rank by the time he is 45 he should of course be placed on\nthe retired list. General officers should be selected as at present,\nand one-third of the other promotions should be made by selection, the\nselection to be made by the President or the Secretary of War from a\nlist of at least two candidates proposed for each vacancy by a board of\nofficers from the arm of the service from which the promotion is to be\nmade. A bill is now before the Congress having for its object to secure\nthe promotion of officers to various grades at reasonable ages through\na process of selection, by boards of officers, of the least efficient\nfor retirement with a percentage of their pay depending upon length of\nservice. The bill, although not accomplishing all that should be done,\nis a long step in the right direction; and I earnestly recommend its\npassage, or that of a more completely effective measure.The cavalry arm should be reorganized upon modern lines. This is an arm\nin which it is peculiarly necessary that the field officers should not\nbe old. The cavalry is much more difficult to form than infantry, and\nit should be kept up to the maximum both in efficiency and in strength,\nfor it can not be made in a hurry. At present both infantry and\nartillery are too few in number for our needs. Especial attention\nshould be paid to development of the machine gun. A general service\ncorps should be established. As things are now the average soldier has\nfar too much labor of a nonmilitary character to perform.NATIONAL GUARD.Now that the organized militia, the National Guard, has been\nincorporated with the Army as a part of the national forces, it\nbehooves the Government to do every reasonable thing in its power to\nperfect its efficiency. It should be assisted in its instruction and\notherwise aided more liberally than heretofore. The continuous services\nof many well-trained regular officers will be essential in this\nconnection. Such officers must be specially trained at service schools\nbest to qualify them as instructors of the National Guard. But the\ndetailing of officers for training at the service schools and for duty\nwith the National Guard entails detaching them from their regiments\nwhich are already greatly depleted by detachment of officers for\nassignment to duties prescribed by acts of the Congress.A bill is now pending before the Congress creating a number of extra\nofficers in the Army, which if passed, as it ought to be, will enable\nmore officers to be trained as instructors of the National Guard and\nassigned to that duty. In case of war it will be of the utmost\nimportance to have a large number of trained officers to use for\nturning raw levies into good troops.There should be legislation to provide a complete plan for organizing\nthe great body of volunteers behind the Regular Army and National Guard\nwhen war has come. Congressional assistance should be given those who\nare endeavoring to promote rifle practice so that our men, in the\nservices or out of them, may know how to use the rifle. While teams\nrepresenting the United States won the rifle and revolver championships\nof the world against all comers in England this year, it is\nunfortunately true that the great body of our citizens shoot less and\nless as time goes on. To meet this we should encourage rifle practice\namong schoolboys, and indeed among all classes, as well as in the\nmilitary services, by every means in our power. Thus, and not\notherwise, may we be able to assist in preserving the peace of the\nworld. Fit to hold our own against the strong nations of the earth, our\nvoice for peace will carry to the ends of the earth. Unprepared, and\ntherefore unfit, we must sit dumb and helpless to defend ourselves,\nprotect others, or preserve peace. The first step--in the direction of\npreparation to avert war if possible, and to be fit for war if it\nshould come--is to teach our men to shoot.THE NAVY.I approve the recommendations of the General Board for the increase of\nthe Navy, calling especial attention to the need of additional\ndestroyers and colliers, and above all, of the four battleships. It is\ndesirable to complete as soon as possible a squadron of eight\nbattleships of the best existing type. The North Dakota, Delaware,\nFlorida, and Utah will form the first division of this squadron. The\nfour vessels proposed will form the second division. It will be an\nimprovement on the first, the ships being of the heavy, single caliber,\nall big gun type. All the vessels should have the same tactical\nqualities--that is, speed and turning circle--and as near as possible\nthese tactical qualities should be the same as in the four vessels\nbefore named now being built.I most earnestly recommend that the General Board be by law turned into\na General Staff. There is literally no excuse whatever for continuing\nthe present bureau organization of the Navy. The Navy should be treated\nas a purely military organization, and everything should be\nsubordinated to the one object of securing military efficiency. Such\nmilitary efficiency can only be guaranteed in time of war if there is\nthe most thorough previous preparation in time of peace--a preparation,\nI may add, which will in all probability prevent any need of war. The\nSecretary must be supreme, and he should have as his official advisers\na body of line officers who should themselves have the power to pass\nupon and coordinate all the work and all the proposals of the several\nbureaus. A system of promotion by merit, either by selection or by\nexclusion, or by both processes, should be introduced. It is out of the\nquestion, if the present principle of promotion by mere seniority is\nkept, to expect to get the best results from the higher officers. Our\nmen come too old, and stay for too short a time, in the high command\npositions.Two hospital ships should be provided. The actual experience of the\nhospital ship with the fleet in the Pacific has shown the invaluable\nwork which such a ship does, and has also proved that it is well to\nhave it kept under the command of a medical officer. As was to be\nexpected, all of the anticipations of trouble from such a command have\nproved completely baseless. It is as absurd to put a hospital ship\nunder a line officer as it would be to put a hospital on shore under\nsuch a command. This ought to have been realized before, and there is\nno excuse for failure to realize it now.Nothing better for the Navy from every standpoint has ever occurred\nthan the cruise of the battle fleet around the world. The improvement\nof the ships in every way has been extraordinary, and they have gained\nfar more experience in battle tactics than they would have gained if\nthey had stayed in the Atlantic waters. The American people have cause\nfor profound gratification, both in view of the excellent condition of\nthe fleet as shown by this cruise, and in view of the improvement the\ncruise has worked in this already high condition. I do not believe that\nthere is any other service in the world in which the average of\ncharacter and efficiency in the enlisted men is as high as is now the\ncase in our own. I believe that the same statement can be made as to\nour officers, taken as a whole; but there must be a reservation made in\nregard to those in the highest ranks--as to which I have already\nspoken--and in regard to those who have just entered the service;\nbecause we do not now get full benefit from our excellent naval school\nat Annapolis. It is absurd not to graduate the midshipmen as ensigns;\nto keep them for two years in such an anomalous position as at present\nthe law requires is detrimental to them and to the service. In the\nacademy itself, every first classman should be required in turn to\nserve as petty officer and officer; his ability to discharge his duties\nas such should be a prerequisite to his going into the line, and his\nsuccess in commanding should largely determine his standing at\ngraduation. The Board of Visitors should be appointed in January, and\neach member should be required to give at least six days' service, only\nfrom one to three days' to be performed during June week, which is the\nleast desirable time for the board to be at Annapolis so far as\nbenefiting the Navy by their observations is concerned.THE WHITE HOUSE,Tuesday, December 8, 1908.",
