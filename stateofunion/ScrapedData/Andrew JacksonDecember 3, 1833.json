    "date": "December 3, 1833", 
    "speech": "Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:On your assembling to perform the high trusts which the people of the\nUnited States have confided to you, of legislating for their common\nwelfare, it gives me pleasure to congratulate you upon the happy\ncondition of our beloved country. By the favor of Divine Providence\nhealth is again restored to us, peace reigns within our borders,\nabundance crowns the labors of our fields, commerce and domestic\nindustry flourish and increase, and individual happiness rewards the\nprivate virtue and enterprise of our citizens.Our condition abroad is no less honorable than it is prosperous at\nhome. Seeking nothing that is not right and determined to submit to\nnothing that is wrong, but desiring honest friendships and liberal\nintercourse with all nations, the United States have gained throughout\nthe world the confidence and respect which are due to a policy so just\nand so congenial to the character of the American people and to the\nspirit of their institutions.In bringing to your notice the particular state of our foreign affairs,\nit affords me high gratification to inform you that they are in a\ncondition which promises the continuance of friendship with all\nnations.With Great Britain the interesting question of our North East boundary\nremains still undecided. A negotiation, however, upon that subject has\nbeen renewed since the close of the last Congress, and a proposition\nhas been submitted to the British Government with the view of\nestablishing, in conformity with the resolution of the Senate, the line\ndesignated by the treaty of 1783. Though no definitive answer has been\nreceived, it may be daily looked for, and I entertain a hope that the\noverture may ultimately lead to a satisfactory adjustment of this\nimportant matter.I have the satisfaction to inform you that a negotiation which, by\ndesire of the House of Representatives, was opened some years ago with\nthe British Government, for the erection of light houses on the\nBahamas, has been successful. Those works, when completed, together\nwith those which the United States have constructed on the western side\nof the Gulf of Florida, will contribute essentially to the safety of\nnavigation in that sea. This joint participation in establishments\ninteresting to humanity and beneficial to commerce is worthy of two\nenlightened nations, and indicates feelings which can not fail to have\na happy influence upon their political relations. It is gratifying to\nthe friends of both to perceive that the intercourse between the two\npeople is becoming daily more extensive, and that sentiments of mutual\ngood will have grown up befitting their common origin and justifying\nthe hope that by wise counsels on each side not only unsettled\nquestions may be satisfactorily terminated, but new causes of\nmisunderstanding prevented.Not withstanding that I continue to receive the most amicable\nassurances from the Government of France, and that in all other\nrespects the most friendly relations exist between the United States\nand that Government, it is to be regretted that the stipulations of the\nconvention concluded on July 4th, 1831 remain in some important parts\nunfulfilled.By the second article of that convention it was stipulated that the sum\npayable to the United States should be paid at Paris, in six annual\ninstallments, into the hands of such person or persons as should be\nauthorized by the Government of the United States to receive it, and by\nthe same article the first installment was payable on February 2d,\n1833. By the act of Congress of July 13th, 1832 it was made the duty of\nthe Secretary of the Treasury to cause the several installments, with\nthe interest thereon, to be received from the French Government and\ntransferred to the United States in such manner as he may deem best;\nand by the same act of Congress the stipulations on the part of the\nUnited States in the convention were in all respects fulfilled. Not\ndoubting that a treaty thus made and ratified by the two Governments,\nand faithfully executed by the United States, would be promptly\ncomplied with by the other party, and desiring to avoid the risk and\nexpense of intermediate agencies, the Secretary of the Treasury deemed\nit advisable to receive and transfer the first installment by means of\na draft upon the French minister of finance.A draft for this purpose was accordingly drawn in favor of the cashier\nof the Bank of the United States for the amount accruing to the United\nStates out of the first installment, and the interest payable with it.\nThis bill was not drawn at Washington until five days after the\ninstallment was payable at Paris, and was accompanied by a special\nauthority from the President authorizing the cashier or his assigns to\nreceive the amount. The mode thus adopted of receiving the installment\nwas officially made known to the French Government by the American\ncharge d'affaires at Paris, pursuant to instructions from the\nDepartment of State. The bill, however, though not presented for\npayment until March 23d, 1833, was not paid, and for the reason\nassigned by the French minister of finance that no appropriation had\nbeen made by the French Chambers. It is not known to me that up to that\nperiod any appropriation had been required of the Chambers, and\nalthough a communication was subsequently made to the Chambers by\ndirection of the King, recommending that the necessary provision should\nbe made for carrying the convention into effect, it was at an advanced\nperiod of the session, and the subject was finally postponed until the\nnext meeting of the Chambers.Not withstanding it has been supposed by the French ministry that the\nfinancial stipulations of the treaty can not be carried into effect\nwithout an appropriation by the Chambers, it appears to me to be not\nonly consistent with the character of France, but due to the character\nof both Governments, as well as to the rights of our citizens, to treat\nthe convention, made and ratified in proper form, as pledging the good\nfaith of the French Government for its execution, and as imposing upon\neach department an obligation to fulfill it; and I have received\nassurances through our charge d'affaires at Paris and the French\nminister plenipotentiary at Washington, and more recently through the\nminister of the United States at Paris, that the delay has not\nproceeded from any indisposition on the part of the King and his\nministers to fulfill their treaty, and that measures will be presented\nat the next meeting of the Chambers, and with a reasonable hope of\nsuccess, to obtain the necessary appropriation.It is necessary to state, however, that the documents, except certain\nlists of vessels captured, condemned, or burnt at sea, proper to\nfacilitate the examination and liquidation of the reclamations\ncomprised in the stipulations of the convention, and which by the 6th\narticle France engaged to communicate to the United States by the\nintermediary of the legation, though repeatedly applied for by the\nAmerican charge d'affaires under instructions from this Government,\nhave not yet been communicated; and this delay, it is apprehended, will\nnecessarily prevent the completion of the duties assigned to the\ncommissioners within the time at present prescribed by law.The reasons for delaying to communicate these documents have not been\nexplicitly stated, and this is the more to be regretted as it is not\nunderstood that the interposition of the Chambers is in any manner\nrequired for the delivery of those papers.Under these circumstances, in a case so important to the interests of\nour citizens and to the character of our country, and under\ndisappointments so unexpected, I deemed it my duty, however I might\nrespect the general assurances to which I have adverted, no longer to\ndelay the appointment of a minister plenipotentiary to Paris, but to\ndispatch him in season to communicate the result of his application to\nthe French Government at an early period of your session. I accordingly\nappointed a distinguished citizen for this purpose, who proceeded on\nhis mission in August last and was presented to the King early in the\nmonth of October. He is particularly instructed as to all matters\nconnected with the present posture of affairs, and I indulge the hope\nthat with the representations he is instructed to make, and from the\ndisposition manifested by the King and his ministers in their recent\nassurances to our minister at Paris, the subject will be early\nconsidered, and satisfactorily disposed of at the next meeting of the\nChambers.As this subject involves important interests and has attracted a\nconsiderable share of the public attention, I have deemed it proper to\nmake this explicit statement of its actual condition, and should I be\ndisappointed in the hope now entertained the subject will be again\nbrought to the notice of Congress in such manner as the occasion may\nrequire.The friendly relations which have always been maintained between the\nUnited States and Russia have been further extended and strengthened by\nthe treaty of navigation and commerce concluded on December 6th, 1832,\nand sanctioned by the Senate before the close of its last session. The\nratifications having been since exchanged, the liberal provisions of\nthe treaty are now in full force, and under the encouragement which\nthey have secured a flourishing and increasing commerce, yielding its\nbenefits to the enterprise of both nations, affords to each the just\nrecompense of wise measures, and adds new motives for that mutual\nfriendship which the two countries have hitherto cherished toward each\nother.It affords me peculiar satisfaction to state that the Government of\nSpain has at length yielded to the justice of the claims which have\nbeen so long urged in behalf of our citizens, and has expressed a\nwillingness to provide an indemnification as soon as the proper amount\ncan be agreed upon. Upon this latter point it is probable an\nunderstanding had taken place between the minister of the United States\nand the Spanish Government before the decease of the late King of\nSpain; and, unless that event may have delayed its completion, there is\nreason to hope that it may be in my power to announce to you early in\nyour present session the conclusion of a convention upon terms not less\nfavorable than those entered into for similar objects with other\nnations. That act of justice would well accord with the character of\nSpain, and is due to the United States from their ancient friend. It\ncould not fail to strengthen the sentiments of amity and good will\nbetween the two nations which it is so much the wish of the United\nStates to cherish and so truly the interest of both to maintain.By the first section of an act of Congress passed on July 13th, 1832\nthe tonnage duty on Spanish ships arriving from the ports of Spain\nprevious to October 20th, 1817, being five cents per ton. That act was\nintended to give effect on our side to an arrangement made with the\nSpanish Government by which discriminating duties of tonnage were to be\nabolished in the ports of the United States and Spain on he vessels of\nthe two nations. Pursuant to that arrangement, which was carried into\neffect on the part of Spain on May 20th, 1832, by a royal order dated\nApril 29th, 1832, American vessels in the ports of Spain have paid five\ncents per ton, which rate of duty is also paid in those ports by\nSpanish ships; but as American vessels pay no tonnage duty in the ports\nof the United States, the duty of five cents payable in our ports by\nSpanish vessels under the act above mentioned is really a\ndiscriminating duty, operating to the disadvantage of Spain.Though no complaint has yet been made on the part of Spain, we are not\nthe less bound by the obligations of good faith to remove the\ndiscrimination, and I recommend that the act be amended accordingly. As\nthe royal order above alluded to includes the ports of the Balearic and\nCanary islands as well as those of Spain, it would seem that the\nprovisions of the act of Congress should be equally extensive, and that\nfor the repayments of such duties as may have been improperly received\nan addition should be made to the sum appropriated at the last session\nof Congress for refunding discriminating duties.As the arrangement referred to, however, did not embrace the islands of\nCuba and Puerto Rico, discriminating duties to the prejudice of\nAmerican shipping continue to be levied there. From the extent of the\ncommerce carried on between the United States and those islands,\nparticularly the former, this discrimination causes serious injury to\none of those great national interests which it has been considered an\nessential part of our policy to cherish, and has given rise to\ncomplaints on the part of our merchants. Under instructions given to\nour minister at Madrid, earnest representations have been made by him\nto the Spanish Government upon this subject, and there is reason to\nexpect, from the friendly disposition which is entertained toward this\ncountry, that a beneficial change will be produced.The disadvantage, however, to which our shipping is subjected by the\noperation of these discriminating duties requires that they be met by\nsuitable countervailing duties during your present session, power being\nat the same time vested in the President to modify or discontinue them\nas the discriminating duties on American vessels or their cargoes may\nbe modified or discontinued at those islands. Intimations have been\ngiven to the Spanish Government that the United States may be obliged\nto resort to such measures as are of necessary self-defense, and there\nis no reason to apprehend that it would be unfavorably received. The\nproposed proceeding if adopted would not be permitted, however, in any\ndegree to induce a relaxation in the efforts of our minister to effect\na repeal of this irregularity by friendly negotiation, and it might\nserve to give force to his representations by showing the dangers to\nwhich that valuable trade is exposed by the obstructions and burdens\nwhich a system of discriminating and countervailing duties necessarily\nproduces.The selection and preparation of the Florida archives for the purpose\nof being delivered over to the United States, in conformity with the\nroyal order as mentioned in my last annual message, though in progress,\nhas not yet been completed. This delay has been produced partly by\ncauses which were unavoidable, particularly the prevalence of the\ncholera at Havana; but measures have been taken which it is believed\nwill expedite the delivery of those important records.Congress were informed at the opening of the last session that \"owing,\nas was alleged, to embarrassments in the finances of Portugal,\nconsequent upon the civil war in which that nation was engaged\",\npayment had been made of only one installment of the amount which the\nPortuguese Government had stipulated to pay for indemnifying our\ncitizens for property illegally captured in the blockade of Terceira.\nSince that time a postponement for two years, with interest, of the two\nremaining installments was requested by the Portuguese Government, and\nas a consideration it offered to stipulate that rice of the United\nStates should be admitted into Portugal at the same duties as Brazilian\nrice. Being satisfied that no better arrangement could be made, my\nconsent was given, and a royal order of the King of Portugal was\naccordingly issued on February 4th, 1833 for the reduction of the duty\non rice of the United States. It would give me great pleasure if in\nspeaking of that country, in whose prosperity the United States are so\nmuch interested, and with whom a long-subsisting, extensive, and\nmutually advantageous commercial intercourse has strengthened the\nrelation of friendship, I could announce to you the restoration of its\ninternal tranquillity.Subsequently to the commencement of the last session of Congress the\nfinal installment payable by Denmark under the convention of March\n28th, 1830 was received. The commissioners for examining the claims\nhave since terminated their labors, and their awards have been paid at\nthe Treasury as they have been called for. The justice rendered to our\ncitizens by that Government is thus completed, and a pledge is thereby\nafforded for the maintenance of that friendly intercourse becoming the\nrelations that the two nations mutually bear to each other.It is satisfactory to inform you that the Danish Government have\nrecently issued an ordinance by which the commerce with the island of\nSt. Croix is placed on a more liberal footing than heretofore. This\nchange can not fail to prove beneficial to the trade between the United\nStates and that colony, and the advantages likely to flow from it may\nlead to greater relaxations in the colonial systems of other nations.The ratifications of the convention with the King of the two Sicilies\nhave been duly exchanged, and the commissioners appointed for examining\nthe claims under it have entered upon the duties assigned to them by\nlaw. The friendship that the interests of the two nations require of\nthem being now established, it may be hoped that each will enjoy the\nbenefits which a liberal commerce should yield to both.A treaty of amity and commerce between the United States and Belgium\nwas concluded during the last winter and received the sanction of the\nSenate, but the exchange of the ratifications has been hitherto\ndelayed, in consequence, in the first instance, of some delay in the\nreception of the treaty at Brussels, and, subsequently, of the absence\nof the Belgian minister of foreign affairs at the important conferences\nin which his Government is engaged at London. That treaty does but\nembody those enlarged principles of friendly policy which it is\nsincerely hoped will always regulate the conduct of the two nations\nhaving such strong motives to maintain amicable relations toward each\nother and so sincerely desirous to cherish them.With all the other European powers with whom the United States have\nformed diplomatic relations and with the Sublime Porte the best\nunderstanding prevails. From all I continue to receive assurances of\ngood will toward the United States--assurances which it gives me no\nless pleasure to reciprocate than to receive. With all, the engagements\nwhich have been entered into are fulfilled with good faith on both\nsides. Measures have also been taken to enlarge our friendly relations\nand extend our commercial intercourse with other States. The system we\nhave pursued of aiming at no exclusive advantages, of dealing with all\non terms of fair and equal reciprocity, and of adhering scrupulously to\nall our engagements is well calculated to give success to efforts\nintended to be mutually beneficial.The wars of which the southern part of this continent was so long the\ntheater, and which were carried on either by the mother country against\nthe States which had formerly been her colonies or by the States\nagainst each other, having terminated, and their civil dissensions\nhaving so far subsided as with few exceptions no longer to disturb the\npublic tranquillity, it is earnestly hoped those States will be able to\nemploy themselves without interruption in perfecting their\ninstitutions, cultivating the arts of peace, and promoting by wise\ncouncils and able exertions the public and private prosperity which\ntheir patriotic struggles so well entitle them to enjoy.With those States our relations have under-gone but little change\nduring the present year. No reunion having yet taken place between the\nStates which composed the Republic of Colombia, our charge d'affaires\nat Bogota has been accredited to the Government of New Grenada, and we\nhave, therefore, no diplomatic relations with Venezuela and Equator,\nexcept as they may be included in those heretofore formed with the\nColombian Republic.It is understood that representatives from the three states were about\nto assemble at Bogota to confer on the subject of their mutual\ninterests, particularly that of their union, and if the result should\nrender it necessary, measures will be taken on our part to preserve\nwith each that friendship and those liberal commercial connections\nwhich it has been the constant desire of the United States to cultivate\nwith their sister Republics of this hemisphere. Until the important\nquestion of reunion shall be settled, however, the different matters\nwhich have been under discussion between the United States and the\nRepublic of Colombia, or either of the States which composed it, are\nnot likely to be brought to a satisfactory issue.In consequence of the illness of the charge d'affaires appointed to\nCentral America at the last session of Congress, he was prevented from\nproceeding on his mission until the month of October. It is hoped,\nhowever, that he is by this time at his post, and that the official\nintercourse, unfortunately so long interrupted, has been thus renewed\non the part of the two nations so amicably and advantageously connected\nby engagements founded on the most enlarged principles of commercial\nreciprocity.It is gratifying to state that since my last annual message some of the\nmost important claims of our fellow citizens upon the Government of\nBrazil have been satisfactorily adjusted, and a reliance is placed on\nthe friendly dispositions manifested by it that justice will also be\ndone in others. No new causes of complaint have arisen, and the trade\nbetween the two countries flourishes under the encouragement secured to\nit by the liberal provisions of the treaty.It is cause of regret that, owing, probably, to the civil dissensions\nwhich have occupied the attention of the Mexican Government, the time\nfixed by the treaty of limits with the United States for the meeting of\nthe commissioners to define the boundaries between the two nations has\nbeen suffered to expire without the appointment of any commissioners on\nthe part of that Government. While the true boundary remains in doubt\nby either party it is difficult to give effect to those measures which\nare necessary to the protection and quiet of our numerous citizens\nresiding near that frontier. The subject is one of great solicitude to\nthe United States, and will not fail to receive my earnest attention.The treaty concluded with Chili and approved by the Senate at its last\nsession was also ratified by the Chilian Government, but with certain\nadditional and explanatory articles of a nature to have required it to\nbe again submitted to the Senate. The time limited for the exchange of\nthe ratification, however, having since expired, the action of both\nGovernments on the treaty will again become necessary.The negotiations commenced with the Argentine Republic relative to the\noutrages committed on our vessels engaged in the fisheries at the\nFalkland Islands by persons acting under the color of its authority, as\nwell as the other matters in controversy between the two Governments,\nhave been suspended by the departure of the charge d'affaires of the\nUnited States from Buenos Ayres. It is understood, however, that a\nminister was subsequently appointed by that Government to renew the\nnegotiation in the United States, but though daily expected he has not\nyet arrived in this country.With Peru no treaty has yet been formed, and with Bolivia no diplomatic\nintercourse has yet been established. It will be my endeavor to\nencourage those sentiments of amity and that liberal commerce which\nbelong to the relations in which all the independent States of this\ncontinent stand toward each other.I deem it proper to recommend to your notice the revision of our\nconsular system. This has become an important branch of the public\nservice, in as much as it is intimately connected with the preservation\nof our national character abroad, with the interest of our citizens in\nforeign countries, with the regulation and care of our commerce, and\nwith the protection of our sea men. At the close of the last session of\nCongress I communicated a report from the Secretary of State upon the\nsubject, to which I now refer, as containing information which may be\nuseful in any inquiries that Congress may see fit to institute with a\nview to a salutary reform of the system.It gives me great pleasure to congratulate you upon the prosperous\ncondition of the finances of the country, as will appear from the\nreport which the Secretary of the Treasury will in due time lay before\nyou. The receipts into the Treasury during the present year will amount\nto more than $32,000,000. The revenue derived from customs will, it is\nbelieved, be more than $28,000,000, and the public lands will yield\nabout $3,0900,000. The expenditures within the year for all objects,\nincluding $2,572,240.99 on account of the public debt, will not amount\nto $25,000,000, and a large balance will remain in the Treasury after\nsatisfying all the appropriations chargeable on the revenue for the\npresent year.The measures taken by the Secretary of the Treasury will probably\nenable to pay off in the course of the present year the residue of the\nexchanged 4.5% stock, redeemable on January 1st, 1834. It has therefore\nbeen included in the estimated expenditures of this year, and forms a\npart of the sum above stated to have been paid on account of the public\ndebt. The payment of this stock will reduce the whole debt of the\nUnited States, funded and unfunded, to the sum of $4,760,082.08, and as\nprovision has already been made for the 4.5% stocks above mentioned,\nand charged in the expenses of the present year, the sum last stated is\nall that now remains of the national debt; and the revenue of the\ncoming year, together with the balance now in the Treasury, will be\nsufficient to discharge it, after meeting the current expenses of the\nGovernment. Under the power given to the commissioners of the sinking\nfund, it will, I have no doubt, be purchased on favorable terms within\nthe year.From this view of the state of the finances and the public engagements\nyet to be fulfilled you will perceive that if Providence permits me to\nmeet you at another session I shall have the high gratification of\nannouncing to you that the national debt is extinguished. I can not\nrefrain from expressing the pleasure I feel at the near approach of\nthat desirable event. The short period of time within which the public\ndebt will have been discharged is strong evidence of the abundant\nresources of the country and of the prudence and economy with which the\nGovernment has heretofore been administered. We have waged two wars\nsince we became a nation, with one of the most powerful kingdoms in the\nworld, both of them undertaken in defense of our dearest rights, been\nsuccessfully prosecuted and honorably terminated; and many of those who\npartook in the first struggle as well as in the second will have lived\nto see the last item of the debt incurred in these necessary but\nexpensive conflicts faithfully and honestly discharged. And we shall\nhave the proud satisfaction of bequeathing to the public servants who\nfollow us in the administration of the Government the rare blessing of\na revenue sufficiently abundant, raised without injustice or oppression\nto our citizens, and unencumbered with any burdens but what they\nthemselves shall think proper to impose upon it.The flourishing state of the finances ought not, however, to encourage\nus to indulge in a lavish expenditure of the public treasure. The\nreceipts of the present year do not furnish the test by which we are to\nestimate the income of the next. The changes made in our revenue system\nby the acts of Congress of 1832 and 1833, and more especially by the\nformer, have swelled the receipts of the present year far beyond the\namount to be expected in future years upon the reduced tariff of\nduties. The shortened credits on revenue bonds and the cash duties on\nwoolens which were introduced by the act of 1832, and took effect on\nMarch 4th, 1832, have brought large sums into the Treasury in 1833,\nwhich, according to the credits formerly given, would not have been\npayable until 1834, and would have formed a part of the income of that\nyear. These causes would of themselves produce a great diminution of\nthe receipts in the year 1834 as compared with the present one, and\nthey will be still more diminished by the reduced rates of duties which\ntake place on January 1st, 1834 on some of the most important and\nproductive articles.Upon the best estimates that can be made the receipts of the next year,\nwith the aid of the unappropriated amount now in the Treasury, will not\nbe much more than sufficient to meet the expenses of the year and pay\nthe small remnant of the national debt which yet remains unsatisfied. I\ncan not, therefore, recommend to you any alteration in the present\ntariff of duties. The rate as now fixed by law on the various articles\nwas adopted at the last session of Congress, as a matter of compromise,\nwith unusual unanimity, and unless it is found to produce more than the\nnecessities of the Government call for there would seem to be no reason\nat this time to justify a change.But while I forbear to recommend any further reduction of the duties\nbeyond that already provided for by the existing laws, I must earnestly\nand respectfully press upon Congress the importance of abstaining from\nall appropriations which are not absolutely required for the public\ninterest and authorized by the powers clearly delegated to the United\nStates. We are beginning a new era in our Government. The national\ndebt, which has so long been a burden on the Treasury, will be finally\ndischarged in the course of the ensuing year. No more memory will\nafterwards be needed than what may be necessary to meet the ordinary\nexpenses of the Government. Now, then, is the proper moment to fix our\nsystem of expenditure on firm and durable principles, and I can not too\nstrongly urge the necessity of a rigid economy and an inflexible\ndetermination not to enlarge the income beyond the real necessities of\nthe Government and not to increase the wants of the Government by\nunnecessary and profuse expenditures.If a contrary course should be pursued, it may happen that the revenue\nof 1834 will fall short of the demands upon it, and after reducing the\ntariff in order to lighten the burdens of the people, and providing for\na still further reduction to take effect hereafter, it would be much to\nbe deplored if at the end of another year we should find ourselves\nobliged to retrace our steps and impose additional taxes to meet\nunnecessary expenditures.It is my duty on this occasion to call your attention to the\ndestruction of the public building occupied by the Treasury Department,\nwhich happened since the last adjournment of Congress. A thorough\ninquiry into the causes of this loss was directed and made at the time,\nthe result of which will be duly communicated to you. I take pleasure,\nhowever, in stating here that by the laudable exertions of the officers\nof the Department and many of the citizens of the District but few\npapers were lost, and none that will materially affect the public\ninterest.The public convenience requires that another building should be erected\nas soon as practicable, and in providing for it it will be advisable to\nenlarge in some manner the accommodations for the public officers of\nthe several Departments, and to authorize the erection of suitable\ndepositories for the safe-keeping of the public documents and records.Since the last adjournment of Congress the Secretary of the Treasury\nhas directed the money of the United States to be deposited in certain\nState banks designated by him, and he will immediately lay before you\nhis reasons for this direction. I concur with him entirely in the view\nhe has taken on the subject, and some months before the removal I urged\nupon the Department the propriety of taking that step. The near\napproach of the day on which the charger will expire, as well as the\nconduct of the bank, appeared to me to call for this measure upon the\nhigh considerations of public interest and public duty. The extent of\nits misconduct, however, although known to be great, was not at that\ntime fully developed by proof. It was not until late in the month of\nAugust that I received from the Government directors an official report\nestablishing beyond question that this great and powerful institution\nhad been actively engaged in attempting to influence the elections of\nthe public officers by means of its money, and that, in violation of\nthe express provisions of its charter, it had by a formal resolution\nplaced its funds at the disposition of its president to be employed in\nsustaining the political power of the bank. A copy of this resolution\nis contained in the report of the Government directors before referred\nto, and how ever the object may be disguised by cautious language, no\none can doubt that this money was in truth intended for electioneering\npurposes, and the particular uses to which it was proved to have been\napplied abundantly show that it was so understood. Not only was the\nevidence complete as to the past application of the money and power of\nthe bank to electioneering purposes, but that the resolution of the\nboard of directors authorized the same course to be pursued in future.It being thus established by unquestionable proof that the Bank of the\nUnited States was converted into a permanent electioneering engine, it\nappeared to me that the path of duty which the executive department of\nthe Government ought to pursue was not doubtful. As by the terms of the\nbank charter no officer but the Secretary of the Treasury could remove\nthe deposits, it seemed to me that this authority ought to be at once\nexerted to deprive that great corporation of the support and\ncountenance of the Government in such an use of its and such an\nexertion of its power. In this point of the case the question is\ndistinctly presented whether the people of the United States are to\ngovern through representatives chosen by their unbiased suffrages or\nwhether the money and power of a great corporation are to be secretly\nexerted to influence their judgment and control their decisions. It\nmust now be determined whether the bank is to have its candidates for\nall offices in the country, from the highest to the lowest, or whether\ncandidates on both sides of political questions shall be brought\nforward as heretofore and supported by the usual means.At this time the efforts of the bank to control public opinion, through\nthe distresses of some and the fears of others, are equally apparent,\nand, if possible, more objectionable. By a curtailment of its\naccommodations more rapid than any emergency requires, and even while\nit retains specie to an almost unprecedented amount in its vaults, it\nis attempting to produce great embarrassment in one portion of the\ncommunity, while through presses known to have been sustained by its\nmoney it attempts by unfounded alarms to create a panic in all.These are the means by which it seems to expect that it can force a\nrestoration of the deposits, and as a necessary consequence extort from\nCongress a renewal of its charter. I am happy to know that through the\ngood sense of our people the effort to get up a panic has hitherto\nfailed, and that through the increased accommodations which the State\nbanks have been enabled to afford, no public distress has followed the\nexertions of the bank, and it can not be doubted that the exercise of\nits power and the expenditure of its money, as well as its efforts to\nspread groundless alarm, will be met and rebuked as they deserve. In my\nown sphere of duty I should feel myself called on by the facts\ndisclosed to order a scire facias against the bank, with a view to put\nan end to the chartered rights it has so palpably violated, were it not\nthat the charter itself will expire as soon as a decision would\nprobably be obtained from the court of last resort.I called the attention of Congress to this subject in my last annual\nmessage, and informed them that such measures as were within the reach\nof the Secretary of the Treasury had been taken to enable him to judge\nwhether the public deposits in the Bank of the United States were\nentirely safe; but that as his single powers might be inadequate to the\nobject, I recommended the subject to Congress as worthy of their\nserious investigation, declaring it as my opinion that an inquiry into\nthe transactions of that institution, embracing the branches as well as\nthe principal bank, was called for by the credit which was given\nthroughout the country to many serious charges impeaching their\ncharacter, and which, if true, might justly excite the apprehension\nthat they were no longer a safe depository for the public money. The\nextent to which the examination thus recommended was gone into is\nspread upon your journals, and is too well known to require to be\nstated. Such as was made resulted in a report from a majority of the\nCommittee of Ways and Means touching certain specified points only,\nconcluding with a resolution that the Government deposits might safely\nbe continued in the Bank of the United States. This resolution was\nadopted at the close of the session by the vote of a majority of the\nHouse of Representatives.Although I may not always be able to concur in the views of the public\ninterest or the duties of its agents which may be taken by the other\ndepartments of the Government or either of its branches, I am, not\nwithstanding, wholly incapable of receiving otherwise than with the\nmost sincere respect all opinions or suggestions proceeding from such a\nsource, and in respect to none am I more inclined to do so than to the\nHouse of Representatives. But it will be seen from the brief views at\nthis time taken of the subject by myself, as well as the more ample\nones presented by the Secretary of the Treasury, that the change in the\ndeposits which has been ordered has been deemed to be called for by\nconsiderations which are not affected by the proceedings referred to,\nand which, if correctly viewed by that Department, rendered its act a\nmatter of imperious duty.Coming as you do, for the most part, immediately from the people and\nthe States by election, and possessing the fullest opportunity to know\ntheir sentiments, the present Congress will be sincerely solicitous to\ncarry into full and fair effect the will of their constituents in\nregard to this institution. It will be for those in whose behalf we all\nact to decide whether the executive department of the Government, in\nthe steps which it has taken on this subject, has been found in the\nline of its duty.The accompanying report of the Secretary of War, with the documents\nannexed to it, exhibits the operations of the War Department for the\npast year and the condition of the various subjects intrusted to its\nadministration.It will be seen from them that the Army maintains the character it has\nheretofore acquired for efficiency and military knowledge. Nothing has\noccurred since your last session to require its services beyond the\nordinary routine duties which upon the sea-board and the in-land\nfrontier devolve upon it in a time of peace. The system so wisely\nadopted and so long pursued of constructing fortifications at exposed\npoints and of preparing and collecting the supplies necessary for the\nmilitary defense of the country, and thus providently furnishing in\npeace the means of defense in war, has been continued with the usual\nresults. I recommend to your consideration the various subjects\nsuggested in the report of the Secretary of War. Their adoption would\npromote the public service and meliorate the condition of the Army.Our relations with the various Indian tribes have been undisturbed\nsince the termination of the difficulties growing out of the hostile\naggressions of the Sac and Fox Indians. Several treaties have been\nformed for the relinquishment of territory to the United States and for\nthe migration of the occupants of the region assigned for their\nresidence West of the Mississippi. Should these treaties be ratified by\nthe Senate, provision will have been made for the removal of almost all\nthe tribes remaining E of that river and for the termination of many\ndifficult and embarrassing questions arising out of their anomalous\npolitical condition.It is to be hoped that those portions of two of the Southern tribes,\nwhich in that event will present the only remaining difficulties, will\nrealize the necessity of emigration, and will speedily resort to it. My\noriginal convictions upon this subject have been confirmed by the\ncourse of events for several years, and experience is every day adding\nto their strength. That those tribes can not exist surrounded by our\nsettlements and in continual contact with our citizens is certain. They\nhave neither the intelligence, the industry, the moral habits, nor the\ndesire of improvement which are essential to any favorable change in\ntheir condition. Established in the midst of another and a superior\nrace, and without appreciating the causes of their inferiority or\nseeking to control them, they must necessarily yield to the force of\ncircumstances and ere long disappear.Such has been their fate heretofore, and if it is to be averted--and it\nis--it can only be done by a general removal beyond our boundary and by\nthe reorganization of their political system upon principles adapted to\nthe new relations in which they will be placed. The experiment which\nhas been recently made has so far proved successful. The emigrants\ngenerally are represented to be prosperous and contented, the country\nsuitable to their wants and habits, and the essential articles of\nsubsistence easily procured. When the report of the commissioners now\nengaged in investigating the condition and prospects of these Indians\nand in devising a plan for their intercourse and government is\nreceived, I trust ample means of information will be in possession of\nthe Government for adjusting all the unsettled questions connected with\nthis interesting subject.The operations of the Navy during the year and its present condition\nare fully exhibited in the annual report from the Navy Department.Suggestions are made by the Secretary of various improvements, which\ndeserve careful consideration, and most of which, if adopted, bid fair\nto promote the efficiency of this important branch of the public\nservice. Among these are the new organization of the Navy Board, the\nrevision of the pay to officers, and a change in the period of time or\nin the manner of making the annual appropriations, to which I beg leave\nto call your particular attention.The views which are presented on almost every portion of our naval\nconcerns, and especially on the amount of force and the number of\nofficers, and the general course of policy appropriate in the present\nstate of our country for securing the great and useful purposes of\nnaval protection in peace and due preparation for the contingencies of\nwar, meet with my entire approbation.It will be perceived from the report referred to that the fiscal\nconcerns of the establishment are in an excellent condition, and it is\nhoped that Congress may feel disposed to make promptly every suitable\nprovision desired either for preserving or improving the system.The general Post Office Department has continued, upon the strength of\nits own resources, to facilitate the means of communication between the\nvarious portions of the Union with increased activity. The method,\nhowever, in which the accounts of the transportation of the mail have\nalways been kept appears to have presented an imperfect view of its\nexpenses. It has recently been discovered that from the earliest\nrecords of the Department the annual statements have been calculated to\nexhibit an amount considerably short of the actual expense incurred for\nthat service. These illusory statements, together with the expense of\ncarrying into effect the law of the last session of Congress\nestablishing new mail routes, and a disposition on the part of the head\nof the Department to gratify the wishes of the public in the extension\nof mail facilities, have induced him to incur responsibilities for\ntheir improvement beyond what the current resources of the Department\nwould sustain. As soon as he had discovered the imperfection of the\nmethod he caused an investigation to be made of its results and applied\nthe proper remedy to correct the evil. It became necessary for him to\nwithdraw some of the improvements which he had made to bring the\nexpenses of the Department within its own resources. These expenses\nwere incurred for the public good, and the public have enjoyed their\nbenefit. They are now but partially suspended, and that where they may\nbe discontinued with the least inconvenience to the country.The progressive increase in the income from postages has equaled the\nhighest expectations, and it affords demonstrative evidence of the\ngrowing importance and great utility of this Department. The details\nare exhibited in the accompanying report of the Post Master General.The many distressing accidents which have of late occurred in that\nportion of our navigation carried on by the use of steam power deserve\nthe immediate and unremitting attention of the constituted authorities\nof the country. The fact that the number of those fatal disasters is\nconstantly increasing, not withstanding the great improvements which\nare every where made in the machinery employed and in the rapid\nadvances which have made in that branch of science, shows very clearly\nthat they are in a great degree the result of criminal negligence on\nthe part of those by whom the vessels are navigated and to whose care\nand attention the lives and property of our citizens are so extensively\nintrusted.That these evils may be greatly lessened, if not substantially removed,\nby means of precautionary and penal legislation seems to be highly\nprobably. So far, therefore, as the subject can be regarded as within\nthe constitutional purview of Congress I earnestly recommend it to your\nprompt and serious consideration.I would also call your attention to the views I have heretofore\nexpressed of the propriety of amending the Constitution in relation to\nthe mode of electing the President and the Vice-President of the United\nStates. Regarding it as all important to the future quiet and harmony\nof the people that every intermediate agency in the election of these\nofficers should be removed and that their eligibility should be limited\nto one term of either four or six years, I can not too earnestly invite\nyour consideration of the subject.Trusting that your deliberations on all the topics of general interest\nto which I have adverted, and such others as your more extensive\nknowledge of the wants of our beloved country may suggest, may be\ncrowned with success, I tender you in conclusion the cooperation which\nit may be in my power to afford them.",
