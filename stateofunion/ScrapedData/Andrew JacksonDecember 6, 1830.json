    "speech": "Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:The pleasure I have in congratulating you upon your return to your\nconstitutional duties is much heightened by the satisfaction which the\ncondition of our beloved country at this period justly inspires. The\nbeneficent Author of All Good has granted to us during the present year\nhealth, peace, and plenty, and numerous causes for joy in the wonderful\nsuccess which attends the progress of our free institutions.With a population unparalleled in its increase, and possessing a\ncharacter which combines the hardihood of enterprise with the\nconsiderateness of wisdom, we see in every section of our happy country\na steady improvement in the means of social intercourse, and\ncorrespondent effects upon the genius and laws of our extended\nRepublic.The apparent exceptions to the harmony of the prospect are to be\nreferred rather to inevitable diversities in the various interests\nwhich enter into the composition of so extensive a whole than any want\nof attachment to the Union--interests whose collisions serve only in\nthe end to foster the spirit of conciliation and patriotism so\nessential to the preservation of that Union which I most devoutly hope\nis destined to prove imperishable.In the midst of these blessings we have recently witnessed changes in\nthe conditions of other nations which may in their consequences call\nfor the utmost vigilance, wisdom, and unanimity in our councils, and\nthe exercise of all the moderation and patriotism of our people.The important modifications of their Government, effected with so much\ncourage and wisdom by the people of France, afford a happy presage of\ntheir future course, and have naturally elicited from the kindred\nfeelings of this nation that spontaneous and universal burst of\napplause in which you have participated. In congratulating you, my\nfellow citizens, upon an event so auspicious to the dearest interests\nof man-kind I do no more than respond to the voice of my country,\nwithout transcending in the slightest degree that salutary maxim of the\nillustrious Washington which enjoins an abstinence from all\ninterference with the internal affairs of other nations. From a people\nexercising in the most unlimited degree the right of self-government,\nand enjoying, as derived from this proud characteristic, under the\nfavor of Heaven, much of the happiness with which they are blessed; a\npeople who can point in triumph to their free institutions and\nchallenge comparison with the fruits they bear, as well as with the\nmoderation, intelligence, and energy with which they are administered--\nfrom such a people the deepest sympathy was to be expected in a\nstruggle for the sacred principles of liberty, conducted in a spirit\nevery way worthy of the cause, and crowned by a heroic moderation which\nhas disarmed revolution of its terrors. Not withstanding the strong\nassurances which the man whom we so sincerely love and justly admire\nhas given to the world of the high character of the present King of the\nFrench, and which if sustained to the end will secure to him the proud\nappellation of Patriot King, it is not in his success, but in that of\nthe great principle which has borne him to the throne--the paramount\nauthority of the public will--that the American people rejoice.I am happy to inform you that the anticipations which were indulged at\nthe date of my last communication on the subject of our foreign affairs\nhave been fully realized in several important particulars.An arrangement has been effected with Great Britain in relation to the\ntrade between the United States and her West India and North American\ncolonies which has settled a question that has for years afforded\nmatter for contention and almost uninterrupted discussion, and has been\nthe subject of no less than six negotiations, in a manner which\npromises results highly favorable to the parties.The abstract right of Great Britain to monopolize the trade with her\ncolonies or to exclude us from a participation therein has never been\ndenied by the United States. But we have contended, and with reason,\nthat if at any time Great Britain may desire the productions of this\ncountry as necessary to her colonies they must be received upon\nprinciples of just reciprocity, and, further, that it is making an\ninvidious and unfriendly distinction to open her colonial ports to the\nvessels of other nations and close them against those of the United\nStates.Antecedently to 1794 a portion of our productions was admitted into the\ncolonial islands of Great Britain by particular concessions, limited to\nthe term of one year, but renewed from year to year. In the\ntransportation of these productions, however, our vessels were not\nallowed to engage, this being a privilege reserved to British shipping,\nby which alone our produce could be taken to the islands and theirs\nbrought to us in return. From Newfoundland and her continental\npossessions all our productions, as well as our vessels, were excluded,\nwith occasional relaxations, by which, in seasons of distress, the\nformer were admitted in British bottoms.By the treaty of 1794 she offered to concede to us for a limited time\nthe right of carrying to her West India possessions in our vessels not\nexceeding 70 tons burthen, and upon the same terms as British vessels,\nany productions of the United States which British vessels might import\ntherefrom. But this privilege was coupled with conditions which are\nsupposed to have led to its rejection by the Senate; that is, that\nAmerican vessels should land their return cargoes in the United States\nonly, and, moreover, that they should during the continuance of the\nprivilege be precluded from carrying molasses, sugar, coffee, cocoa, or\ncotton either from those islands or from the United States to any other\npart of the world. Great Britain readily consented to expunge this\narticle from the treaty, and subsequent attempts to arrange the terms\nof the trade either by treaty stipulations or concerted legislation\nhave failed, it has been successively suspended and allowed according\nto the varying legislation of the parties.The following are the prominent points which have in later years\nseparated the two Governments: Besides a restriction whereby all\nimportations into her colonies in American vessels are confined to our\nown products carried hence, a restriction to which it does not appear\nthat we have ever objected, a leading object on the part of Great\nBritain has been to prevent us from becoming the carriers of British\nWest India commodities to any other country than our own. On the part\nof the United States it has been contended, first, that the subject\nshould be regulated by treaty stipulation in preference to separate\nlegislation; second, that our productions, when imported into the\ncolonies in question, should not be subject to higher duties than the\nproductions of the mother country or of her other colonial possessions,\nand, 3rd, that our vessels should be allowed to participate in the\ncircuitous trade between the United States and different parts of the\nBritish dominions.The first point, after having been for a long time strenuously insisted\nupon by Great Britain, was given up by the act of Parliament of July,\n1825, all vessels suffered to trade with the colonies being permitted\nto clear from thence with any articles which British vessels might\nexport and proceed to any part of the world, Great Britain and her\ndependencies alone excepted. On our part each of the above points had\nin succession been explicitly abandoned in negotiations preceding that\nof which the result is now announced.This arrangement secures to the United States every advantage asked by\nthem, and which the state of the negotiation allowed us to insist upon.\nThe trade will be placed upon a footing decidedly more favorable to\nthis country than any on which it ever stood, and our commerce and\nnavigation will enjoy in the colonial ports of Great Britain every\nprivilege allowed to other nations.That the prosperity of the country so far as it depends on this trade\nwill be greatly promoted by the new arrangement there can be no doubt.\nIndependently of the more obvious advantages of an open and direct\nintercourse, its establishment will be attended with other consequences\nof a higher value. That which has been carried on since the mutual\ninterdict under all the expense and inconvenience unavoidably incident\nto it would have been insupportably onerous had it not been in a great\ndegree lightened by concerted evasions in the mode of making the\ntransshipments at what are called the neutral ports. These indirections\nare inconsistent with the dignity of nations that have so many motives\nnot only to cherish feelings of mutual friendship, but to maintain such\nrelations as will stimulate their respective citizens and subjects to\nefforts of direct, open, and honorable competition only, and preserve\nthem from the influence of seductive and vitiating circumstances.When your preliminary interposition was asked at the close of the last\nsession, a copy of the instructions under which Mr. McLane has acted,\ntogether with the communications which had at that time passed between\nhim and the British Government, was laid before you. Although there has\nnot been any thing in the acts of the two Governments which requires\nsecrecy, it was thought most proper in the then state of the\nnegotiation to make that communication a confidential one. So soon,\nhowever, as the evidence of execution on the part of Great Britain is\nreceived the whole matter shall be laid before you, when it will be\nseen that the apprehension which appears to have suggested one of the\nprovisions of the act passed at your last session, that the restoration\nof the trade in question might be connected with other subjects and was\nsought to be obtained at the sacrifice of the public interest in other\nparticulars, was wholly unfounded, and that the change which has taken\nplace in the views of the British Government has been induced by\nconsiderations as honorable to both parties as I trust the result will\nprove beneficial.This desirable result was, it will be seen, greatly promoted by the\nliberal and confiding provisions of the act of Congress of the last\nsession, by which our ports were upon the reception and annunciation by\nthe President of the required assurance on the part of Great Britain\nforthwith opened to her vessels before the arrangement could be carried\ninto effect on her part, pursuing in this act of prospective\nlegislation a similar course to that adopted by Great Britain in\nabolishing, by her act of Parliament in 1825, a restriction then\nexisting and permitting our vessels to clear from the colonies on their\nreturn voyages for any foreign country whatever before British vessels\nhad been relieved from the restriction imposed by our law of returning\ndirectly from the United States to the colonies, a restriction which\nshe required and expected that we should abolish. Upon each occasion a\nlimited and temporary advantage has been given to the opposite party,\nbut an advantage of no importance in comparison with the restoration of\nmutual confidence and good feeling, and the ultimate establishment of\nthe trade upon fair principles.It gives me unfeigned pleasure to assure you that this negotiation has\nbeen throughout characterized by the most frank and friendly spirit on\nthe part of Great Britain, and concluded in a manner strongly\nindicative of a sincere desire to cultivate the best relations with the\nUnited States. To reciprocate this disposition to the fullest extent of\nmy ability is a duty which I shall deem it a privilege to discharge.Although the result is itself the best commentary on the services\nrendered to his country by our minister at the Court of St. James, it\nwould be doing violence to my feelings were I to dismiss the subject\nwithout expressing the very high sense I entertain of the talent and\nexertion which have been displayed by him on the occasion.The injury to the commerce of the United States resulting from the\nexclusion of our vessels from the Black Sea and the previous footing of\nmere sufferance upon which even the limited trade enjoyed by us with\nTurkey has hitherto been placed have for a long time been a source of\nmuch solicitude to this Government, and several endeavors have been\nmade to obtain a better state of things. Sensible of the importance of\nthe object, I felt it my duty to leave no proper means unemployed to\nacquire for our flag the same privileges that are enjoyed by the\nprincipal powers of Europe. Commissioners were consequently appointed\nto open a negotiation with the Sublime Porte. Not long after the member\nof the commission who went directly from the United States had sailed,\nthe account of the treaty of Adrianople, by which one of the objects in\nview was supposed to be secured, reached this country. The Black Sea\nwas understood to be opened to us. Under the supposition that this was\nthe case, the additional facilities to be derived from the\nestablishment of commercial regulations with the Porte were deemed of\nsufficient importance to require a prosecution of the negotiation as\noriginally contemplated. It was therefore persevered in, and resulted\nin a treaty, which will be forthwith laid before the Senate.By its provisions a free passage is secured, without limitations of\ntime, to the vessels of the United States to and from the Black Sea,\nincluding the navigation thereof, and our trade with Turkey is placed\non the footing of the most favored nation. The latter is an arrangement\nwholly independent of the treaty of Adrianople, and the former derives\nmuch value, not only from the increased security which under any\ncircumstances it would give to the right in question, but from the\nfact, ascertained in the course of the negotiation, that by the\nconstruction put upon that treaty by Turkey the article relating to the\npassage of the Bosphorus is confined to nations having treaties with\nthe Porte. The most friendly feelings appear to be entertained by the\nSultan, and an enlightened disposition is evinced by him to foster the\nintercourse between the two countries by the most liberal arrangements.\nThis disposition it will be our duty and interest to cherish.Our relations with Russia are of the most stable character. Respect for\nthat Empire and confidence in its friendship toward the United States\nhave been so long entertained on our part and so carefully cherished by\nthe present Emperor and his illustrious predecessor as to have become\nincorporated with the public sentiment of the United States. No means\nwill be left unemployed on my part to promote these salutary feelings\nand those improvements of which the commercial intercourse between the\ntwo countries is susceptible, and which have derived increased\nimportance from our treaty with the Sublime Porte.I sincerely regret to inform you that our minister lately commissioned\nto that Court, on whose distinguished talents and great experience in\npublic affairs I place great reliance, has been compelled by extreme\nindisposition to exercise a privilege which, in consideration of the\nextent to which his constitution had been impaired in the public\nservice, was committed to his discretion--of leaving temporarily his\npost for the advantage of a more genial climate.If, as it is to be hoped, the improvement of his health should be such\nas to justify him in doing so, he will repair to St. Petersburg and\nresume the discharge of his official duties. I have received the most\nsatisfactory assurances that in the mean time the public interest in\nthat quarter will be preserved from prejudice by the intercourse which\nhe will continue through the secretary of legation with the Russian\ncabinet.You are apprised, although the fact has not yet been officially\nannounced to the House of Representatives, that a treaty was in the\nmonth of March last concluded between the United States, and Denmark,\nby which $650 thousand are secured to our citizens as an indemnity for\nspoliations upon their commerce in the years 1808, 1809, 1810, and\n1811. This treaty was sanctioned by the Senate at the close of its last\nsession, and it now becomes the duty of Congress to pass the necessary\nlaws for the organization of the board of commissioners to distribute\nthe indemnity among the claimants. It is an agreeable circumstance in\nthis adjustment that the terms are in conformity with the previously\nascertained views of the claimants themselves, thus removing all\npretense for a future agitation of the subject in any form.The negotiations in regard to such points in our foreign relations as\nremain to be adjusted have been actively prosecuted during the recess.\nMaterial advances have been made, which are of a character to promise\nfavorable results. Our country, by the blessing of God, is not in a\nsituation to invite aggression, and it will be our fault if she ever\nbecomes so. Sincerely desirous to cultivate the most liberal and\nfriendly relations with all; ever ready to fulfill our engagements with\nscrupulous fidelity; limiting our demands upon others to mere justice;\nholding ourselves ever ready to do unto them as we would wish to be\ndone by, and avoiding even the appearance of undue partiality to any\nnation, it appears to me impossible that a simple and sincere\napplication of our principles to our foreign relations can fail to\nplace them ultimately upon the footing on which it is our wish they\nshould rest.Of the points referred to, the most prominent are our claims upon\nFrance for spoliations upon our commerce; similar claims upon Spain,\ntogether with embarrassments in the commercial intercourse between the\ntwo countries which ought to be removed; the conclusion of the treaty\nof commerce and navigation with Mexico, which has been so long in\nsuspense, as well as the final settlement of limits between ourselves\nand that Republic, and, finally, the arbitrament of the question\nbetween the United States and Great Britain in regard to the\nnorth-eastern boundary.The negotiation with France has been conducted by our minister with\nzeal and ability, and in all respects to my entire satisfaction.\nAlthough the prospect of a favorable termination was occasionally\ndimmed by counter pretensions to which the United States could not\nassent, he yet had strong hopes of being able to arrive at a\nsatisfactory settlement with the late Government. The negotiation has\nbeen renewed with the present authorities, and, sensible of the general\nand lively confidence of our citizens in the justice and magnanimity of\nregenerated France, I regret the more not to have it in my power yet to\nannounce the result so confidently anticipated. No ground, however,\ninconsistent with this expectation has yet been taken, and I do not\nallow myself to doubt that justice will soon be done us. The amount of\nthe claims, the length of time they have remained unsatisfied, and\ntheir incontrovertible justice make an earnest prosecution of them by\nthis Government an urgent duty. The illegality of the seizures and\nconfiscations out of which they have arisen is not disputed, and what\never distinctions may have heretofore been set up in regard to the\nliability of the existing Government it is quite clear that such\nconsiderations can not now be interposed.The commercial intercourse between the two countries is susceptible of\nhighly advantageous improvements, but the sense of this injury has had,\nand must continue to have, a very unfavorable influence upon them. From\nits satisfactory adjustment not only a firm and cordial friendship, but\na progressive development of all their relations, may be expected. It\nis, therefore, my earnest hope that this old and vexatious subject of\ndifference may be speedily removed.I feel that my confidence in our appeal to the motives which should\ngovern a just and magnanimous nation is alike warranted by the\ncharacter of the French people and by the high voucher we possess for\nthe enlarged views and pure integrity of the Monarch who now presides\nover their councils, and nothing shall be wanting on my part to meet\nany manifestation of the spirit we anticipate in one of corresponding\nfrankness and liberality.The subjects of difference with Spain have been brought to the view of\nthat Government by our minister there with much force and propriety,\nand the strongest assurances have been received of their early and\nfavorable consideration.The steps which remained to place the matter in controversy between\nGreat Britain and the United States fairly before the arbitrator have\nall been taken in the same liberal and friendly spirit which\ncharacterized those before announced. Recent events have doubtless\nserved to delay the decision, but our minister at the Court of the\ndistinguished arbitrator has been assured that it will be made within\nthe time contemplated by the treaty.I am particularly gratified in being able to state that a decidedly\nfavorable, and, as I hope, lasting, change has been effected in our\nrelations with the neighboring Republic of Mexico. The unfortunate and\nunfounded suspicions in regard to our disposition which it became my\npainful duty to advert to on a former occasion have been, I believe,\nentirely removed, and the Government of Mexico has been made to\nunderstand the real character of the wishes and views of this in regard\nto that country. The consequences is the establishment of friendship\nand mutual confidence. Such are the assurances I have received, and I\nsee no cause to doubt their sincerity.I had reason to expect the conclusion of a commercial treaty with\nMexico in season for communication on the present occasion.\nCircumstances which are not explained, but which I am persuaded are not\nthe result of an indisposition on her part to enter into it, have\nproduced the delay.There was reason to fear in the course of the last summer that the\nharmony of our relations might be disturbed by the acts of certain\nclaimants, under Mexican grants, of territory which had hitherto been\nunder our jurisdiction. The cooperation of the representative of Mexico\nnear this Government was asked on the occasion and was readily\nafforded. Instructions and advice have been given to the governor of\nArkansas and the officers in command in the adjoining Mexican State by\nwhich it is hoped the quiet of that frontier will be preserved until a\nfinal settlement of the dividing line shall have removed all ground of\ncontroversy.The exchange of ratifications of the treaty concluded last year with\nAustria has not yet taken place. The delay has been occasioned by the\nnon-arrival of the ratification of that Government within the time\nprescribed by the treaty. Renewed authority has been asked for by the\nrepresentative of Austria, and in the mean time the rapidly increasing\ntrade and navigation between the two countries have been placed upon\nthe most liberal footing of our navigation acts.Several alleged depredations have been recently committed on our\ncommerce by the national vessels of Portugal. They have been made the\nsubject of immediate remonstrance and reclamation. I am not yet\npossessed of sufficient information to express a definitive opinion of\ntheir character, but expect soon to receive it. No proper means shall\nbe omitted to obtain for our citizens all the redress to which they may\nappear to be entitled.Almost at the moment of the adjournment of your last session two\nbills--the one entitled \"An act for making appropriations for building\nlight houses, light boats, beacons, and monuments, placing buoys, and\nfor improving harbors and directing surveys\", and the other \"An act to\nauthorize a subscription for stock in the Louisville and Portland Canal\nCompany\"--were submitted for my approval. It was not possible within\nthe time allowed for me before the close of the session to give to\nthese bills the consideration which was due to their character and\nimportance, and I was compelled to retain them for that purpose. I now\navail myself of this early opportunity to return them to the Houses in\nwhich they respectively originated with the reasons which, after mature\ndeliberation, compel me to withhold my approval.The practice of defraying out of the Treasury of the United States the\nexpenses incurred by the establishment and support of light houses,\nbeacons, buoys, and public piers within the bays, inlets, harbors, and\nports of the United States, to render the navigation thereof safe and\neasy, is coeval with the adoption of the Constitution, and has been\ncontinued without interruption or dispute.As our foreign commerce increased and was extended into the interior of\nthe country by the establishment of ports of entry and delivery upon\nour navigable rivers the sphere of those expenditures received a\ncorresponding enlargement. Light houses, beacons, buoys, public piers,\nand the removal of sand bars, sawyers, and other partial or temporary\nimpediments in the navigable rivers and harbors which were embraced in\nthe revenue districts from time to time established by law were\nauthorized upon the same principle and the expense defrayed in the same\nmanner. That these expenses have at times been extravagant and\ndisproportionate is very probable. The circumstances under which they\nare incurred are well calculated to lead to such a result unless their\napplication is subjected to the closest scrutiny. The local advantages\narising from the disbursement of public money too frequently, it is to\nbe feared, invite appropriations for objects of this character that are\nneither necessary nor useful.The number of light house keepers is already very large, and the bill\nbefore me proposes to add to it 51 more of various descriptions. From\nrepresentations upon the subject which are understood to be entitled to\nrespect I am induced to believe that there has not only been great\nimprovidence in the past expenditures of the Government upon these\nobjects, but that the security of navigation has in some instances been\ndiminished by the multiplication of light houses and consequent change\nof lights upon the coast. It is in this as in other respects our duty\nto avoid all unnecessary expense, as well as every increase of\npatronage not called for by the public service.But in the discharge of that duty in this particular it must not be\nforgotten that in relation to our foreign commerce the burden and\nbenefit of protecting and accommodating it necessarily go together, and\nmust do so as long as the public revenue is drawn from the people\nthrough the custom house. It is indisputable that whatever gives\nfacility and security to navigation cheapens imports and all who\nconsume them are alike interested in what ever produces this effect. If\nthey consume, they ought, as they now do, to pay; otherwise they do not\npay. The consumer in the most inland State derives the same advantage\nfrom every necessary and prudent expenditure for the facility and\nsecurity of our foreign commerce and navigation that he does who\nresides in a maritime State. Local expenditures have not of themselves\na corresponding operation.From a bill making direct appropriations for such objects I should\nnot have withheld my assent. The one now returned does so in several\nparticulars, but it also contains appropriations for surveys of local\ncharacter, which I can not approve. It gives me satisfaction to find\nthat no serious inconvenience has arisen from withholding my approval\nfrom this bill; nor will it, I trust, be cause of regret that an\nopportunity will be thereby afforded for Congress to review its\nprovisions under circumstances better calculated for full investigation\nthan those under which it was passed.In speaking of direct appropriations I mean not to include a practice\nwhich has obtained to some extent, and to which I have in one instance,\nin a different capacity, given my assent--that of subscribing to the\nstock of private associations. Positive experience and a more thorough\nconsideration of the subject have convinced me of the impropriety as\nwell as inexpediency of such investments. All improvements effected by\nthe funds of the nation for general use should be open to the enjoyment\nof all our fellow citizens, exempt from the payment of tolls or any\nimposition of that character. The practice of thus mingling the\nconcerns of the Government with those of the States or of individuals\nis inconsistent with the object of its institution and highly impolite.\nThe successful operation of the federal system can only be preserved by\nconfining it to the few and simple, but yet important, objects for\nwhich it was designed.A different practice, if allowed to progress, would ultimately change\nthe character of this Government by consolidating into one the General\nand State Governments, which were intended to be kept for ever\ndistinct. I can not perceive how bills authorizing such subscriptions\ncan be otherwise regarded than as bills for revenue, and consequently\nsubject to the rule in that respect prescribed by the Constitution. If\nthe interest of the Government in private companies is subordinate to\nthat of individuals, the management and control of a portion of the\npublic funds is delegated to an authority unknown to the Constitution\nand beyond the supervision of our constituents; if superior, its\nofficers and agents will be constantly exposed to imputations of\nfavoritism and oppression. Direct prejudice the public interest or an\nalienation of the affections and respect of portions of the people may,\ntherefore, in addition to the general discredit resulting to the\nGovernment from embarking with its constituents in pecuniary\nstipulations, be looked for as the probable fruit of such associations.\nIt is no answer to this objection to say that the extent of\nconsequences like these can not be great from a limited and small\nnumber of investments, because experience in other matters teaches\nus--and we are not at liberty to disregard its admonitions--that unless\nan entire stop be put to them it will soon be impossible to prevent\ntheir accumulation until they are spread over the whole country and\nmade to embrace many of the private and appropriate concerns of\nindividuals.The power which the General Government would acquire within the several\nStates by becoming the principal stock-holder in corporations,\ncontrolling every canal and each 60 or 100 miles of every important\nroad, and giving a proportionate vote in all their elections, is almost\ninconceivable, and in my view dangerous to the liberties of the people.This mode of aiding such works is also in its nature deceptive, and in\nmany cases conducive to improvidence in the administration of the\nnational funds. Appropriations will be obtained with much greater\nfacility and granted with less security to the public interest when the\nmeasure is thus disguised than when definite and direct expenditures of\nmoney are asked for. The interests of the nation would doubtless be\nbetter served by avoiding all such indirect modes of aiding particular\nobjects. In a government like ours more especially should all public\nacts be, as far as practicable, simple, undisguised, and intelligible,\nthat they may become fit subjects for the approbation to animadversion\nof the people.The bill authorizing a subscription to the Louisville and Portland\nCanal affords a striking illustration of the difficulty of withholding\nadditional appropriations for the same object when the first erroneous\nstep has been taken by instituting a partnership between the Government\nand private companies. It proposes a third subscription on the part of\nthe United States, when each preceding one was at the time regarded as\nthe extent of the aid which Government was to render to that work; and\nthe accompanying bill for light houses, etc., contains an appropriation\nfor a survey of the bed of the river, with a view to its improvement by\nremoving the obstruction which the canal is designed to avoid. This\nimprovement, if successful, would afford a free passage of the river\nand render the canal entirely useless. To such improvidence is the\ncourse of legislation subject in relation to internal improvements on\nlocal matters, even with the best intentions on the part of Congress.Although the motives which have influenced me in this matter may be\nalready sufficiently stated, I am, never the less, induced by its\nimportance to add a few observations of a general character.In my objections to the bills authorizing subscriptions to the\nMaysville and Rockville road companies I expressed my views fully in\nregard to the power of Congress to construct roads and canals within a\nState of to appropriate money for improvements of a local character. I\nat the same time intimated me belief that the right to make\nappropriations for such as were of a national character had been so\ngenerally acted upon and so long acquiesced in by the Federal and State\nGovernments and the constituents of each as to justify its exercise on\nthe ground of continued and uninterrupted usage, but that it was, never\nthe less, highly expedient that appropriations even of that character\nshould, with the exception made at the time, be deferred until the\nnational debt is paid, and that in the mean while some general rule for\nthe action of the Government in that respect ought to be established.These suggestions were not necessary to the decision of the question\nthen before me, and were, I readily admit, intended to awake the\nattention and draw forth the opinion and observations of our\nconstituents upon a subject of the highest importance to their\ninterests, and one destined to exert a powerful influence upon the\nfuture operations of our political system. I know of no tribunal to\nwhich a public man in this country, in a case of doubt and difficulty,\ncan appeal with greater advantage or more propriety than the judgment\nof the people; and although I must necessarily in the discharge of my\nofficial duties be governed by the dictates of my own judgment, I have\nno desire to conceal my anxious wish to conform as far as I can to the\nviews of those for whom I act.All irregular expressions of public opinion are of necessity attended\nwith some doubt as to their accuracy, but making full allowances on\nthat account I can not, I think, deceive myself in believing that the\nacts referred to, as well as the suggestions which I allowed myself to\nmake in relation to their bearing upon the future operations of the\nGovernment, have been approved by the great body of the people. That\nthose whose immediate pecuniary interests are to be affected by\nproposed expenditures should shrink from the application of a rule\nwhich prefers their more general and remote interests to those which\nare personal and immediate is to be expected. But even such objections\nmust from the nature of our population be but temporary in their\nduration, and if it were otherwise our course should be the same, for\nthe time is yet, I hope, far distant when those intrusted with power to\nbe exercised for the good of the whole will consider it either honest\nor wise to purchase local favors at the sacrifice of principle and\ngeneral good.So understanding public sentiment, and thoroughly satisfied that the\nbest interests of our common country imperiously require that the\ncourse which I have recommended in this regard should be adopted, I\nhave, upon the most mature consideration, determined to pursue it.It is due to candor, as well as to my own feelings, that I should\nexpress the reluctance and anxiety which I must at all times experience\nin exercising the undoubted right of the Executive to withhold his\nassent from bills on other grounds than their constitutionality. That\nthis right should not be exercised on slight occasions all will admit.\nIt is only in matters of deep interest, when the principle involved may\nbe justly regarded as next in importance to infractions of the\nConstitution itself, that such a step can be expected to meet with the\napprobation of the people. Such an occasion do I conscientiously\nbelieve the present to be.In the discharge of this delicate and highly responsible duty I am\nsustained by the reflection that the exercise of this power has been\ndeemed consistent with the obligation of official duty by several of my\npredecessors, and by the persuasion, too, that what ever liberal\ninstitutions may have to fear from the encroachments of Executive\npower, which has been every where the cause of so much strife and\nbloody contention, but little danger is to be apprehended from a\nprecedent by which that authority denies to itself the exercise of\npowers that bring in their train influence and patronage of great\nextent, and thus excludes the operation of personal interests, every\nwhere the bane of official trust.I derive, too, no small degree of satisfaction from the reflection that\nif I have mistaken the interests and wishes of the people the\nConstitution affords the means of soon redressing the error by\nselecting for the place their favor has bestowed upon me a citizen\nwhose opinions may accord with their own. I trust, in the mean time,\nthe interests of the nation will be saved from prejudice by a rigid\napplication of that portion of the public funds which might otherwise\nbe applied to different objects to that highest of all our obligations,\nthe payment of the public debt, and an opportunity be afforded for the\nadoption of some better rule for the operations of the Government in\nthis matter than any which has hitherto been acted upon.Profoundly impressed with the importance of the subject, not merely as\nrelates to the general prosperity of the country, but to the safety of\nthe federal system, I can not avoid repeating my earnest hope that all\ngood citizens who take a proper interest in the success and harmony of\nour admirable political institutions, and who are incapable of desiring\nto convert an opposite state of things into means for the gratification\nof personal ambition, will, laying aside minor considerations and\ndiscarding local prejudices, unite their honest exertions to establish\nsome fixed general principle which shall be calculated to effect the\ngreatest extent of public good in regard to the subject of internal\nimprovement, and afford the least ground for sectional discontent.The general grounds of my objection to local appropriations have been\nheretofore expressed, and I shall endeavor to avoid a repetition of\nwhat has been already urged--the importance of sustaining the State\nsovereignties as far as is consistent with the rightful action of the\nFederal Government, and of preserving the greatest attainable harmony\nbetween them. I will now only add an expression of my conviction--a\nconviction which every day's experience serves to confirm--that the\npolitical creed which inculcates the pursuit of those great objects as\na paramount duty is the true faith, and one to which we are mainly\nindebted for the present success of the entire system, and to which we\nmust alone look for its future stability.That there are diversities in the interests of the different States\nwhich compose this extensive Confederacy must be admitted. Those\ndiversities arising from situation, climate, population, and pursuits\nare doubtless, as it is natural they should be, greatly exaggerated by\njealousies and that spirit of rivalry so inseparable from neighboring\ncommunities. These circumstances make it the duty of those who are\nintrusted with the management of its affairs to neutralize their\neffects as far as practicable by making the beneficial operation of the\nFederal Government as equal and equitable among the several States as\ncan be done consistently with the great ends of its institution.It is only necessary to refer to undoubted facts to see how far the\npast acts of the Government upon the subject under consideration have\nfallen short of this object. The expenditures heretofore made for\ninternal improvements amount to upward of $5 millions, and have been\ndistributed in very unequal proportions amongst the States. The\nestimated expense of works of which surveys have been made, together\nwith that of others projected and partially surveyed, amounts to more\nthan $96 millions.That such improvements, on account of particular circumstances, may be\nmore advantageously and beneficially made in some States than in others\nis doubtless true, but that they are of a character which should\nprevent an equitable distribution of the funds amongst the several\nStates is not to be conceded. The want of this equitable distribution\ncan not fail to prove a prolific source of irritation among the States.We have it constantly before our eyes that professions of superior zeal\nin the cause of internal improvement and a disposition to lavish the\npublic funds upon objects of this character are daily and earnestly put\nforth by aspirants to power as constituting the highest claims to the\nconfidence of the people. Would it be strange, under such\ncircumstances, and in times of great excitement, that grants of this\ndescription should find their motives in objects which may not accord\nwith the public good? Those who have not had occasion to see and regret\nthe indication of a sinister influence in these matters in past times\nhave been more fortunate than myself in their observation of the course\nof public affairs. If to these evils be added the combinations and\nangry contentions to which such a course of things gives rise, with\ntheir baleful influences upon the legislation of Congress touching the\nleading and appropriate duties of the Federal Government, it was but\ndoing justice to the character of our people to expect the severe\ncondemnation of the past which the recent exhibitions of public\nsentiment has evinced.Nothing short of a radical change in the action of the Government upon\nthe subject can, in my opinion, remedy the evil. If, as it would be\nnatural to expect, the States which have been least favored in past\nappropriations should insist on being redressed in those here after to\nbe made, at the expense of the States which have so largely and\ndisproportionately participated, we have, as matters now stand, but\nlittle security that the attempt would do more than change the\ninequality from one quarter to another.Thus viewing the subject, I have heretofore felt it my duty to\nrecommend the adoption of some plan for the distribution of the surplus\nfunds, which may at any time remain in the Treasury after the national\ndebt shall have been paid, among the States, in proportion to the\nnumber of their Representatives, to be applied by them to objects of\ninternal improvement.Although this plan has met with favor in some portions of the Union, it\nhas also elicited objections which merit deliberate consideration. A\nbrief notice of these objections here will not, therefore, I trust, be\nregarded as out of place.They rest, as far as they have come to my knowledge, on the following\ngrounds: first, an objection to the ration of distribution; second, an\napprehension that the existence of such a regulation would produce\nimprovident and oppressive taxation to raise the funds for\ndistribution; 3rd, that the mode proposed would lead to the\nconstruction of works of a local nature, to the exclusion of such as\nare general and as would consequently be of a more useful character;\nand, last, that it would create a discreditable and injurious\ndependence on the part of the State governments upon the Federal power.Of those who object to the ration of representatives as the basis of\ndistribution, some insist that the importations of the respective\nStates would constitute one that would be more equitable; and others\nagain, that the extent of their respective territories would furnish a\nstandard which would be more expedient and sufficiently equitable. The\nration of representation presented itself to my mind, and it still\ndoes, as one of obvious equity, because of its being the ratio of\ncontribution, whether the funds to be distributed be derived from the\ncustoms or from direct taxation. It does not follow, however, that its\nadoption is indispensable to the establishment of the system proposed.\nThere may be considerations appertaining to the subject which would\nrender a departure, to some extent, from the rule of contribution\nproper. Nor is it absolutely necessary that the basis of distribution\nbe confined to one ground. It may, if in the judgment of those whose\nright it is to fix it it be deemed politic and just to give it that\ncharacter, have regard to several.In my first message I stated it to be my opinion that \"it is not\nprobably that any adjustment of the tariff upon principles satisfactory\nto the people of the Union will until a remote period, if ever, leave\nthe Government without a considerable surplus in the Treasury beyond\nwhat may be required for its current surplus\". I have had no cause to\nchange that opinion, but much to confirm it. Should these expectations\nbe realized, a suitable fund would thus be produced for the plan under\nconsideration to operate upon, and if there be no such fund its\nadoption will, in my opinion, work no injury to any interest; for I can\nnot assent to the justness of the apprehension that the establishment\nof the proposed system would tend to the encouragement of improvident\nlegislation of the character supposed. What ever the proper authority\nin the exercise of constitutional power shall at any time here after\ndecide to be for the general good will in that as in other respects\ndeserve and receive the acquiescence and support of the whole country,\nand we have ample security that every abuse of power in that regard by\nagents of the people will receive a speedy and effectual corrective at\ntheir hands. The views which I take of the future, founded on the\nobvious and increasing improvement of all classes of our fellow\ncitizens in intelligence and in public and private virtue, leave me\nwithout much apprehension on that head.I do not doubt that those who come after us will be as much alive as we\nare to the obligation upon all the trustees of political power to\nexempt those for whom they act from all unnecessary burthens, and as\nsensible of the great truth that the resources of the nation beyond\nthose required for immediate and necessary purposes of Government can\nno where be so well deposited as in the pockets of the people.It may some times happen that the interests of particular States would\nnot be deemed to coincide with the general interest in relation to\nimprovements within such States. But if the danger to be apprehended\nfrom this source is sufficient to require it, a discretion might be\nreserved to Congress to direct to such improvements of a general\ncharacter as the States concerned might not be disposed to unite in,\nthe application of the quotas of those States, under the restriction of\nconfining to each State the expenditure of its appropriate quota. It\nmay, however, be assumed as a safe general rule that such improvements\nas serve to increase the prosperity of the respective States in which\nthey are made, by giving new facilities to trade, and thereby\naugmenting the wealth and comfort of their inhabitants, constitute the\nsurest mode of conferring permanent and substantial advantages upon the\nwhole. The strength as well as the true glory of the Confederacy is\nfounded on the prosperity and power of the several independent\nsovereignties of which it is composed and the certainty with which they\ncan be brought into successful active cooperation through the agency of\nthe Federal Government.It is, more over, within the knowledge of such as are at all conversant\nwith public affairs that schemes of internal improvement have from time\nto time been proposed which, from their extent and seeming\nmagnificence, were readily regarded as of national concernment, but\nwhich upon fuller consideration and further experience would now be\nrejected with great unanimity.That the plan under consideration would derive important advantages\nfrom its certainty, and that the moneys set apart for these purposes\nwould be more judiciously applied and economically expended under the\ndirection of the State legislatures, in which every part of each State\nis immediately represented, can not, I think, be doubted. In the new\nStates particularly, where a comparatively small population is\nscattered over an extensive surface, and the representation in Congress\nconsequently very limited, it is natural to expect that the\nappropriations made by the Federal Government would be more likely to\nbe expended in the vicinity of those numbers through whose immediate\nagency they were obtained than if the funds were placed under the\ncontrol of the legislature, in which every county of the State has its\nown representative. This supposition does not necessarily impugn the\nmotives of such Congressional representatives, nor is it so intended.\nWe are all sensible of the bias to which the strongest minds and purest\nhearts are, under such circumstances, liable. In respect to the last\nobjection--its probable effect upon the dignity and independence of\nState governments--it appears to me only necessary to state the case as\nit is, and as it would be if the measure proposed were adopted, to show\nthat the operation is most likely to be the very reverse of that which\nthe objection supposes.In the one case the State would receive its quota of the national\nrevenue for domestic use upon a fixed principle as a matter of right,\nand from a fund to the creation of which it had itself contributed its\nfair proportion. Surely there could be nothing derogatory in that. As\nmatters now stand the States themselves, in their sovereign character,\nare not unfrequently petitioners at the bar of the Federal Legislature\nfor such allowances out of the National Treasury as it may comport with\ntheir pleasure or sense of duty to bestow upon them. It can not require\nargument to prove which of the two courses is most compatible with the\nefficiency or respectability of the State governments.But all these are matters for discussion and dispassionate\nconsideration. That the desired adjustment would be attended with\ndifficulty affords no reason why it should not be attempted. The\neffective operation of such motives would have prevented the adoption\nof the Constitution under which we have so long lived and under the\nbenign influence of which our beloved country has so signally\nprospered. The framers of that sacred instrument had greater\ndifficulties to overcome, and they did overcome them. The patriotism of\nthe people, directed by a deep conviction of the importance of the\nUnion, produced mutual concession and reciprocal forbearance. Strict\nright was merged in a spirit of compromise, and the result has\nconsecrated their disinterested devotion to the general weal. Unless\nthe American people have degenerated, the same result can be again\neffected when ever experience points out the necessity of a resort to\nthe same means to uphold the fabric which their fathers have reared.It is beyond the power of man to make a system of government like ours\nor any other operate with precise equality upon States situated like\nthose which compose this Confederacy; nor is inequality always\ninjustice. Every State can not expect to shape the measures of the\nGeneral Government to suit its own particular interests. The causes\nwhich prevent it are seated in the nature of things, and can not be\nentirely counteracted by human means. Mutual forbearance becomes,\ntherefore, a duty obligatory upon all, and we may, I am confident,\ncount upon a cheerful compliance with this high injunction on the part\nof our constituents. It is not to be supposed that they will object to\nmake such comparatively inconsiderable sacrifices for the preservation\nof rights and privileges which other less favored portions of the world\nhave in vain waded through seas of blood to acquire.Our course is a safe one if it be but faithfully adhered to.\nAcquiescence in the constitutionally expressed will of the majority,\nand the exercise of that will in a spirit of moderation, justice, and\nbrotherly kindness, will constitute a cement which would for ever\npreserve our Union. Those who cherish and inculcate sentiments like\nthese render a most essential service to their country, while those who\nseek to weaken their influence are, how ever conscientious and praise\nworthy their intentions, in effect its worst enemies.If the intelligence and influence of the country, instead of laboring\nto foment sectional prejudices, to be made subservient to party\nwarfare, were in good faith applied to the eradication of causes of\nlocal discontent, by the improvement of our institutions and by\nfacilitating their adaptation to the condition of the times, this task\nwould prove one of less difficulty. May we not hope that the obvious\ninterests of our common country and the dictates of an enlightened\npatriotism will in the end lead the public mind in that direction?After all, the nature of the subject does not admit of a plan wholly\nfree from objection. That which has for some time been in operation is,\nperhaps, the worst that could exist, and every advance that can be made\nin its improvement is a matter eminently worthy of your most deliberate\nattention.It is very possible that one better calculated to effect the objects in\nview may yet be devised. If so, it is to be hoped that those who\ndisapprove the past and dissent from what is proposed for the future\nwill feel it their duty to direct their attention to it, as they must\nbe sensible that unless some fixed rule for the action of the Federal\nGovernment in this respect is established the course now attempted to\nbe arrested will be again resorted to. Any mode which is calculated to\ngive the greatest degree of effect and harmony to our legislation upon\nthe subject, which shall best serve to keep the movements of the\nFederal Government within the sphere intended by those who modeled and\nthose who adopted it, which shall lead to the extinguishment of the\nnational debt in the shortest period and impose the lightest burthens\nupon our constituents, shall receive from me a cordial and firm\nsupport.Among the objects of great national concern I can not omit to press\nagain upon your attention that part of the Constitution which regulates\nthe election of President and Vice-President. The necessity for its\namendment is made so clear to my mind by observation of its evils and\nby the many able discussions which they have elicited on the floor of\nCongress and elsewhere that I should be wanting to my duty were I to\nwithhold another expression of my deep solicitude on the subject. Our\nsystem fortunately contemplates a recurrence to first principles,\ndiffering in this respect from all that have preceded it, and securing\nit, I trust, equally against the decay and the commotions which have\nmarked the progress of other governments.Our fellow citizens, too, who in proportion to their love of liberty\nkeep a steady eye upon the means of sustaining it, do not require to be\nreminded of the duty they owe to themselves to remedy all essential\ndefects in so vital a part of their system. While they are sensible\nthat every evil attendant upon its operation is not necessarily\nindicative of a bad organization, but may proceed from temporary\ncauses, yet the habitual presence, or even a single instance, of evils\nwhich can be clearly traced to an organic defect will not, I trust, be\nover-looked through a too scrupulous veneration for the work of their\nancestors.The Constitution was an experiment committed to the virtue and\nintelligence of the great mass of our country-men, in whose ranks the\nframers of it themselves were to perform the part of patriotic\nobservation and scrutiny, and if they have passed from the stage of\nexistence with an increased confidence in its general adaptation to our\ncondition we should learn from authority so high the duty of fortifying\nthe points in it which time proves to be exposed rather than be\ndeterred from approaching them by the suggestions of fear or the\ndictates of misplaced reverence.A provision which does not secure to the people a direct choice of\ntheir Chief Magistrate, but has a tendency to defeat their will,\npresented to my mind such an inconsistence with the general spirit of\nour institutions that I was indeed to suggest for your consideration\nthe substitute which appeared to me at the same time the most likely to\ncorrect the evil and to meet the views of our constituents. The most\nmature reflection since has added strength to the belief that the best\ninterests of our country require the speedy adoption of some plan\ncalculated to effect this end. A contingency which some times places it\nin the power of a single member of the House of Representatives to\ndecide an election of so high and solemn a character is unjust to the\npeople, and becomes when it occurs a source of embarrassment to the\nindividuals thus brought into power and a cause of distrust of the\nrepresentative body.Liable as the Confederacy is, from its great extent, to parties founded\nupon sectional interests, and to a corresponding multiplication of\ncandidates for the Presidency, the tendency of the constitutional\nreference to the House of Representatives is to devolve the election\nupon that body in almost every instance, and, what ever choice may then\nbe made among the candidates thus presented to them, to swell the\ninfluence of particular interests to a degree inconsistent with the\ngeneral good. The consequences of this feature of the Constitution\nappear far more threatening to the peace and integrity of the Union\nthan any which I can conceive as likely to result from the simple\nlegislative action of the Federal Government.It was a leading object with the framers of the Constitution to keep as\nseparate as possible the action of the legislative and executive\nbranches of the Government. To secure this object nothing is more\nessential than to preserve the former from all temptations of private\ninterest, and therefore so to direct the patronage of the latter as not\nto permit such temptations to be offered. Experience abundantly\ndemonstrates that every precaution in this respect is a valuable\nsafe-guard of liberty, and one which my reflections upon the tendencies\nof our system incline me to think should be made still stronger.It was for this reason that, in connection with an amendment of the\nConstitution removing all intermediate agency in the choice of the\nPresident, I recommended some restrictions upon the re-eligibility of\nthat officer and upon the tenure of offices generally. The reason still\nexists, and I renew the recommendation with an increased confidence\nthat its adoption will strengthen those checks by which the\nConstitution designed to secure the independence of each department of\nthe Government and promote the healthful and equitable administration\nof all the trusts which it has created.The agent most likely to contravene this design of the Constitution is\nthe Chief Magistrate. In order, particularly, that his appointment may\nas far as possible be placed beyond the reach of any improper\ninfluences; in order that he may approach the solemn responsibilities\nof the highest office in the gift of a free people uncommitted to any\nother course than the strict line of constitutional duty, and that the\nsecurities for this independence may be rendered as strong as the\nnature of power and the weakness of its possessor will admit, I can not\ntoo earnestly invite your attention to the propriety of promoting such\nan amendment of the Constitution as will render him ineligible after\none term of service.It gives me pleasure to announce to Congress that the benevolent policy\nof the Government, steadily pursued for nearly 30 years, in relation to\nthe removal of the Indians beyond the white settlements is approaching\nto a happy consummation. Two important tribes have accepted the\nprovision made for their removal at the last session of Congress, and\nit is believed that their example will induce the remaining tribes also\nto seek the same obvious advantages.The consequences of a speedy removal will be important to the United\nStates, to individual States, and to the Indians themselves. The\npecuniary advantages which it promises to the Government are the least\nof its recommendations. It puts an end to all possible danger of\ncollision between the authorities of the General and State Governments\non account of the Indians. It will place a dense and civilized\npopulation in large tracts of country now occupied by a few savage\nhunters. By opening the whole territory between Tennessee on the north\nand Louisiana on the south to the settlement of the whites it will\nincalculably strengthen the south west frontier and render the adjacent\nStates strong enough to repel future invasions without remote aid. It\nwill relieve the whole State of Mississippi and the western part of\nAlabama of Indian occupancy, and enable those States to advance rapidly\nin population, wealth, and power. It will separate the Indians from\nimmediate contact with settlements of whites; free them from the power\nof the States; enable them to pursue happiness in their own way and\nunder their own rude institutions; will retard the progress of decay,\nwhich is lessening their numbers, and perhaps cause them gradually,\nunder the protection of the Government and through the influence of\ngood counsels, to cast off their savage habits and become an\ninteresting, civilized, and Christian community. These consequences,\nsome of them so certain and the rest so probable, make the complete\nexecution of the plan sanctioned by Congress at their last session an\nobject of much solicitude.Toward the aborigines of the country no one can indulge a more friendly\nfeeling than myself, or would go further in attempting to reclaim them\nfrom their wandering habits and make them a happy, prosperous people. I\nhave endeavored to impress upon them my own solemn convictions of the\nduties and powers of the General Government in relation to the State\nauthorities. For the justice of the laws passed by the States within\nthe scope of their reserved powers they are not responsible to this\nGovernment. As individuals we may entertain and express our opinions of\ntheir acts, but as a Government we have as little right to control them\nas we have to prescribe laws for other nations.With a full understanding of the subject, the Choctaw and the Chickasaw\ntribes have with great unanimity determined to avail themselves of the\nliberal offers presented by the act of Congress, and have agreed to\nremove beyond the Mississippi River. Treaties have been made with them,\nwhich in due season will be submitted for consideration. In negotiating\nthese treaties they were made to understand their true condition, and\nthey have preferred maintaining their independence in the Western\nforests to submitting to the laws of the States in which they now\nreside. These treaties, being probably the last which will ever be made\nwith them, are characterized by great liberality on the part of the\nGovernment. They give the Indians a liberal sum in consideration of\ntheir removal, and comfortable subsistence on their arrival at their\nnew homes. If it be their real interest to maintain a separate\nexistence, they will there be at liberty to do so without the\ninconveniences and vexations to which they would unavoidably have been\nsubject in Alabama and Mississippi.Humanity has often wept over the fate of the aborigines of this\ncountry, and Philanthropy has been long busily employed in devising\nmeans to avert it, but its progress has never for a moment been\narrested, and one by one have many powerful tribes disappeared from the\nearth. To follow to the tomb the last of his race and to tread on the\ngraves of extinct nations excite melancholy reflections. But true\nphilanthropy reconciles the mind to these vicissitudes as it does to\nthe extinction of one generation to make room for another. In the\nmonuments and fortifications of an unknown people, spread over the\nextensive regions of the West, we behold the memorials of a once\npowerful race, which was exterminated of has disappeared to make room\nfor the existing savage tribes. Nor is there any thing in this which,\nupon a comprehensive view of the general interests of the human race,\nis to be regretted. Philanthropy could not wish to see this continent\nrestored to the condition in which it was found by our forefathers.\nWhat good man would prefer a country covered with forests and ranged by\na few thousand savages to our extensive Republic, studded with cities,\ntowns, and prosperous farms, embellished with all the improvements\nwhich art can devise or industry execute, occupied by more than\n12,000,000 happy people, and filled with all the blessings of liberty,\ncivilization, and religion?The present policy of the Government is but a continuation of the same\nprogressive change by a milder process. The tribes which occupied the\ncountries now constituting the Eastern States were annihilated or have\nmelted away to make room for the whites. The waves of population and\ncivilization are rolling to the westward, and we now propose to acquire\nthe countries occupied by the red men of the South and West by a fair\nexchange, and, at the expense of the United States, to send them to a\nland where their existence may be prolonged and perhaps made perpetual.Doubtless it will be painful to leave the graves of their fathers; but\nwhat do they more than our ancestors did or than our children are now\ndoing? To better their condition in an unknown land our forefathers\nleft all that was dear in earthly objects. Our children by thousands\nyearly leave the land of their birth to seek new homes in distant\nregions. Does Humanity weep at these painful separations from every\nthing, animate and inanimate, with which the young heart has become\nentwined? Far from it. It is rather a source of joy that our country\naffords scope where our young population may range unconstrained in\nbody or in mind, developing the power and faculties of man in their\nhighest perfection.These remove hundreds and almost thousands of miles at their own\nexpense, purchase the lands they occupy, and support themselves at\ntheir new homes from the moment of their arrival. Can it be cruel in\nthis Government when, by events which it can not control, the Indian is\nmade discontented in his ancient home to purchase his lands, to give\nhim a new and extensive territory, to pay the expense of his removal,\nand support him a year in his new abode? How many thousands of our own\npeople would gladly embrace the opportunity of removing to the West on\nsuch conditions! If the offers made to the Indians were extended to\nthem, they would be hailed with gratitude and joy.And is it supposed that the wandering savage has a stronger attachment\nto his home than the settled, civilized Christian? Is it more\nafflicting to him to leave the graves of his fathers than it is to our\nbrothers and children? Rightly considered, the policy of the General\nGovernment toward the red man is not only liberal, but generous. He is\nunwilling to submit to the laws of the States and mingle with their\npopulation. To save him from this alternative, or perhaps utter\nannihilation, the General Government kindly offers him a new home, and\nproposes to pay the whole expense of his removal and settlement.In the consummation of a policy originating at an early period, and\nsteadily pursued by every Administration within the present century--so\njust to the States and so generous to the Indians--the Executive feels\nit has a right to expect the cooperation of Congress and of all good\nand disinterested men. The States, moreover, have a right to demand it.\nIt was substantially a part of the compact which made them members of\nour Confederacy. With Georgia there is an express contract; with the\nnew States an implied one of equal obligation. Why, in authorizing\nOhio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Mississippi, and Alabama to form\nconstitutions and become separate States, did Congress include within\ntheir limits extensive tracts of Indian lands, and, in some instances,\npowerful Indian tribes? Was it not understood by both parties that the\npower of the States was to be coextensive with their limits, and that\nwith all convenient dispatch the General Government should extinguish\nthe Indian title and remove every obstruction to the complete\njurisdiction of the State governments over the soil? Probably not one\nof those States would have accepted a separate existence--certainly it\nwould never have been granted by Congress--had it been understood that\nthey were to be confined for ever to those small portions of their\nnominal territory the Indian title to which had at the time been\nextinguished.It is, therefore, a duty which this Government owes to the new States\nto extinguish as soon as possible the Indian title to all lands which\nCongress themselves have included within their limits. When this is\ndone the duties of the General Government in relation to the States and\nthe Indians within their limits are at an end. The Indians may leave\nthe State or not, as they choose. The purchase of their lands does not\nalter in the least their personal relations with the State government.\nNo act of the General Government has ever been deemed necessary to give\nthe States jurisdiction over the persons of the Indians. That they\npossess by virtue of their sovereign power within their own limits in\nas full a manner before as after the purchase of the Indian lands; nor\ncan this Government add to or diminish it.May we not hope, therefore, that all good citizens, and none more\nzealously than those who think the Indians oppressed by subjection to\nthe laws of the States, will unite in attempting to open the eyes of\nthose children of the forest to their true condition, and by a speedy\nremoval to relieve them from all the evils, real or imaginary, present\nor prospective, with which they may be supposed to be threatened.Among the numerous causes of congratulation the condition of our impost\nrevenue deserves special mention, in as much as it promises the means\nof extinguishing the public debt sooner than was anticipated, and\nfurnishes a strong illustration of the practical effects of the present\ntariff upon our commercial interests.The object of the tariff is objected to by some as unconstitutional,\nand it is considered by almost all as defective in many of its parts.The power to impose duties on imports originally belonged to the\nseveral States. The right to adjust those duties with a view to the\nencouragement of domestic branches of industry is so completely\nincidental to that power that it is difficult to suppose the existence\nof the one without the other. The States have delegated their whole\nauthority over imports to the General Government without limitation or\nrestriction, saving the very inconsiderable reservation relating to\ntheir inspection laws. This authority having thus entirely passed from\nthe States, the right to exercise it for the purpose of protection does\nnot exist in them, and consequently if it be not possessed by the\nGeneral Government it must be extinct. Our political system would thus\npresent the anomaly of a people stripped of the right to foster their\nown industry and to counteract the most selfish and destructive policy\nwhich might be adopted by foreign nations. This sure can not be the\ncase. This indispensable power thus surrendered by the States must be\nwithin the scope of the authority on the subject expressly delegated to\nCongress.In this conclusion I am confirmed as well by the opinions of Presidents\nWashington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, who have each repeatedly\nrecommended the exercise of this right under the Constitution, as by\nthe uniform practice of Congress, the continued acquiescence of the\nStates, and the general understanding of the people.The difficulties of a more expedient adjustment of the present tariff,\nalthough great, are far from being insurmountable. Some are unwilling\nto improve any of its parts because they would destroy the whole;\nothers fear to touch the objectionable parts lest those they approve\nshould be jeoparded. I am persuaded that the advocates of these\nconflicting views do injustice to the American people and to their\nrepresentatives. The general interest is the interest of each, and my\nconfidence is entire that to insure the adoption of such modifications\nof the tariff as the general interest requires it is only necessary\nthat that interest should be understood.It is an infirmity of our nature to mingle our interests and prejudices\nwith the operation of our reasoning powers, and attribute to the\nobjects of our likes and dislikes qualities they do not possess and\neffects they can not produce. The effects of the present tariff are\ndoubtless over-rated, both in its evils and in its advantages. By one\nclass of reasoners the reduced price of cotton and other agricultural\nproducts is ascribed wholly to its influence, and by another the\nreduced price of manufactured articles.The probability is that neither opinion approaches the truth, and that\nboth are induced by that influence of interests and prejudices to which\nI have referred. The decrease of prices extends throughout the\ncommercial world, embracing not only the raw material and the\nmanufactured article, but provisions and lands. The cause must\ntherefore be deeper and more pervading than the tariff of the United\nStates. It may in a measure be attributable to the increased value of\nthe precious metals, produced by a diminution of the supply and an\nincrease in the demand, while commerce has rapidly extended itself and\npopulation has augmented. The supply of gold and silver, the general\nmedium of exchange, has been greatly interrupted by civil convulsions\nin the countries from which they are principally drawn. A part of the\neffect, too, is doubtless owing to an increase of operatives and\nimprovements in machinery. But on the whole it is questionable whether\nthe reduction in the price of lands, produce, and manufactures has been\ngreater than the appreciation of the standard of value.While the chief object of duties should be revenue, they may be so\nadjusted as to encourage manufactures. In this adjustment, however, it\nis the duty of the Government to be guided by the general good. Objects\nof national importance alone ought to be protected. Of these the\nproductions of our soil, our mines, and our work shops, essential to\nnational defense, occupy the first rank. What ever other species of\ndomestic industry, having the importance to which I have referred, may\nbe expected, after temporary protection, to compete with foreign labor\non equal terms merit the same attention in a subordinate degree.The present tariff taxes some of the comforts of life unnecessarily\nhigh; it undertakes to protect interests too local and minute to\njustify a general exaction, and it also attempts to force some kinds of\nmanufactures for which the country is not ripe. Much relief will be\nderived in some of these respects from the measures of your last\nsession.The best as well as fairest mode of determining whether from any just\nconsiderations a particular interest ought to receive protection would\nbe to submit the question singly for deliberation. If after\ndue examination of its merits, unconnected with extraneous\nconsiderations--such as a desire to sustain a general system or to\npurchase support for a different interest--it should enlist in its\nfavor a majority of the representatives of the people, there can be\nlittle danger of wrong or injury in adjusting the tariff with reference\nto its protective effect. If this obviously just principle were\nhonestly adhered to, the branches of industry which deserve protection\nwould be saved from the prejudice excited against them when that\nprotection forms part of a system by which portions of the country feel\nor conceive themselves to be oppressed. What is incalculably more\nimportant, the vital principle of our system--that principle which\nrequires acquiescence in the will of the majority--would be secure from\nthe discredit and danger to which it is exposed by the acts of\nmajorities founded not on identity of conviction, but on combinations\nof small minorities entered into for the purpose of mutual assistance\nin measures which, resting solely on their own merits, could never be\ncarried.I am well aware that this is a subject of so much delicacy, on account\nof the extended interests in involves, as to require that it should be\ntouched with the utmost caution, and that while an abandonment of the\npolicy in which it originated--a policy coeval with our Government, and\npursued through successive Administrations--is neither to be expected\nor desired, the people have a right to demand, and have demanded, that\nit be so modified as to correct abuses and obviate injustice.That our deliberations on this interesting subject should be\nuninfluenced by those partisan conflicts that are incident to free\ninstitutions is the fervent wish of my heart. To make this great\nquestion, which unhappily so much divides and excites the public mind,\nsubservient to the short-sighted views of faction, must destroy all\nhope of settling it satisfactorily to the great body of the people and\nfor the general interest. I can not, therefore, in taking leave of the\nsubject, too earnestly for my own feelings or the common good warn you\nagainst the blighting consequences of such a course.According to the estimates at the Treasury Department, the receipts in\nthe Treasury during the present year will amount to $24,161,018, which\nwill exceed by about $300,000 the estimate presented in the last annual\nreport of the Secretary of the Treasury. The total expenditure during\nthe year, exclusive of public debt, is estimated at $13,742,311, and\nthe payment on account of public debt for the same period will have\nbeen $11,354,630, leaving a balance in the Treasury on January 1st,\n1831 of $4,819,781.In connection with the condition of our finances, it affords me\npleasure to remark that judicious and efficient arrangements have been\nmade by the Treasury Department for securing the pecuniary\nresponsibility of the public officers and the more punctual payment of\nthe public dues. The Revenue Cutter Service has been organized and\nplaced on a good footing, and aided by an increase of inspectors at\nexposed points, and regulations adopted under the act of May, 1830, for\nthe inspection and appraisement of merchandise, has produced much\nimprovement in the execution of the laws and more security against the\ncommission of frauds upon the revenue. Abuses in the allowances for\nfishing bounties have also been corrected, and a material saving in\nthat branch of the service thereby effected. In addition to these\nimprovements the system of expenditure for sick sea men belonging to\nthe merchant service has been revised, and being rendered uniform and\neconomical the benefits of the fund applicable to this object have been\nusefully extended.The prosperity of our country is also further evinced by the increased\nrevenue arising from the sale of public lands, as will appear from the\nreport of the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the documents\naccompanying it, which are herewith transmitted. I beg leave to draw\nyour attention to this report, and to the propriety of making early\nappropriations for the objects which it specifies.Your attention is again invited to the subjects connected with that\nportion of the public interests intrusted to the War Department. Some\nof them were referred to in my former message, and they are presented\nin detail in the report of the Secretary of War herewith submitted. I\nrefer you also to the report of that officer for a knowledge of the\nstate of the Army, fortifications, arsenals, and Indian affairs, all of\nwhich it will be perceived have been guarded with zealous attention and\ncare. It is worthy of your consideration whether the armaments\nnecessary for the fortifications on our maritime frontier which are now\nor shortly will be completed should not be in readiness sooner than the\ncustomary appropriations will enable the Department to provide them.\nThis precaution seems to be due to the general system of fortification\nwhich has been sanctioned by Congress, and is recommended by that maxim\nof wisdom which tells us in peace to prepare for war.I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy for a highly\nsatisfactory account of the manner in which the concerns of that\nDepartment have been conducted during the present year. Our position in\nrelation to the most powerful nations of the earth, and the present\ncondition of Europe, admonish us to cherish this arm of our national\ndefense with peculiar care. Separated by wide seas from all those\nGovernments whose power we might have reason to dread, we have nothing\nto apprehend from attempts at conquest. It is chiefly attacks upon our\ncommerce and harrassing in-roads upon our coast against which we have\nto guard. A naval force adequate to the protection of our commerce,\nalways afloat, with an accumulation of the means to give it a rapid\nextension in case of need, furnishes the power by which all such\naggressions may be prevented or repelled. The attention of the\nGovernment has therefore been recently directed more to preserving the\npublic vessels already built and providing materials to be placed in\ndepot for future use than to increasing their number. With the aid of\nCongress, in a few years the Government will be prepared in case of\nemergency to put afloat a powerful navy of new ships almost as soon as\nold ones could be repaired.The modifications in this part of the service suggested in my last\nannual message, which are noticed more in detail in the report of the\nSecretary of the Navy, are again recommended to your serious attention.The report of the Post Master General in like manner exhibits a\nsatisfactory view of the important branch of the Government under his\ncharge. In addition to the benefits already secured by the operations\nof the Post Office Department, considerable improvements within the\npresent year have been made by an increase in the accommodation\nafforded by stage coaches, and in the frequency and celerity of the\nmail between some of the most important points of the Union.Under the late contracts improvements have been provided for the\nsouthern section of the country, and at the same time an annual saving\nmade of upward of $72,000. Not with standing the excess of expenditure\nbeyond the current receipts for a few years past, necessarily incurred\nin the fulfillment of existing contracts and in the additional expenses\nbetween the periods of contracting to meet the demands created by the\nrapid growth and extension of our flourishing country, yet the\nsatisfactory assurance is given that the future revenue of the\nDepartment will be sufficient to meets its extensive engagements. The\nsystem recently introduced that subjects its receipts and disbursements\nto strict regulation has entirely fulfilled its designs. It gives full\nassurance of the punctual transmission, as well as the security of the\nfunds of the Department. The efficiency and industry of its officers\nand the ability and energy of contractors justify an increased\nconfidence in its continued prosperity.The attention of Congress was called on a former occasion to the\nnecessity of such a modification in the office of Attorney General of\nthe United States as would render it more adequate to the wants of the\npublic service. This resulted in the establishment of the office of\nSolicitor of the Treasury, and the earliest measures were taken to give\neffect to the provisions of the law which authorized the appointment of\nthat officer and defined his duties. But it is not believed that this\nprovision, however useful in itself, is calculated to supersede the\nnecessity of extending the duties and powers of the Attorney General's\nOffice. On the contrary, I am convinced that the public interest would\nbe greatly promoted by giving to that officer the general\nsuperintendence of the various law agents of the Government, and of all\nlaw proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which the United States\nmay be interested, allowing him at the same time such compensation as\nwould enable him to devote his undivided attention to the public\nbusiness. I think such a provision is alike due to the public and to\nthe officer.Occasions of reference from the different Executive Departments to the\nAttorney General are of frequent occurrence, and the prompt decision of\nthe questions so referred tends much to facilitate the dispatch of\nbusiness in those Departments. The report of the Secretary of the\nTreasury hereto appended shows also a branch of the public service not\nspecifically intrusted to any officer which might be advantageously\ncommitted to the Attorney General. But independently of those\nconsiderations this office is now one of daily duty. It was originally\norganized and its compensation fixed with a view to occasional service,\nleaving to the incumbent time for the exercise of his profession in\nprivate practice. The state of things which warranted such an\norganization no longer exists. The frequent claims upon the services of\nthis officer would render his absence from the seat of Government in\nprofessional attendance upon the courts injurious to the public\nservice, and the interests of the Government could not fail to be\npromoted by charging him with the general superintendence of all its\nlegal concerns.Under a strong conviction of the justness of these suggestions, I\nrecommend it to Congress to make the necessary provisions for giving\neffect to them, and to place the Attorney General in regard to\ncompensation on the same footing with the heads of the several\nExecutive Departments. To this officer might also be intrusted a\ncognizance of the cases of insolvency in public debtors, especially if\nthe views which I submitted on this subject last year should meet the\napprobation of Congress--to which I again solicit your attention.Your attention is respectfully invited to the situation of the District\nof Columbia. Placed by the Constitution under the exclusive\njurisdiction and control of Congress, this District is certainly\nentitled to a much greater share of its consideration than it has yet\nreceived. There is a want of uniformity in its laws, particularly in\nthose of a penal character, which increases the expense of their\nadministration and subjects the people to all the inconveniences which\nresult from the operation of different codes in so small a territory.\nOn different sides of the Potomac the same offense is punishable in\nunequal degrees, and the peculiarities of many of the early laws of\nMaryland and Virginia remain in force, not with standing their\nrepugnance in some cases to the improvements which have superseded them\nin those States.Besides a remedy for these evils, which is loudly called for, it is\nrespectfully submitted whether a provision authorizing the election of\na delegate to represent the wants of the citizens of this District on\nthe floor of Congress is not due to them and to the character of our\nGovernment. No principles of freedom, and there is none more important\nthan that which cultivates a proper relation between the governors and\nthe governed. Imperfect as this must be in this case, yet it is\nbelieved that it would be greatly improved by a representation in\nCongress with the same privileges that are allowed to the other\nTerritories of the United States.The penitentiary is ready for the reception of convicts, and only\nawaits the necessary legislation to put it into operation, as one\nobject of which I beg leave to recall your attention to the propriety\nof providing suitable compensation for the officers charged with its\ninspection.The importance of the principles involved in the inquiry whether it\nwill be proper to recharter the Bank of the United States requires that\nI should again call the attention of Congress to the subject. Nothing\nhas occurred to lessen in any degree the dangers which many of our\ncitizens apprehend from that institution as at present organized. In\nthe spirit of improvement and compromise which distinguishes our\ncountry and its institutions it becomes us to inquire whether it be not\npossible to secure the advantages afforded by the present bank through\nthe agency of a Bank of the United States so modified in its principles\nand structures as to obviate constitutional and other objections.It is thought practicable to organize such a bank with the necessary\nofficers as a branch of the Treasury Department, based on the public\nand individual deposits, without power to make loans or purchase\nproperty, which shall remit the funds of the Government, and the\nexpense of which may be paid, if thought advisable, by allowing its\nofficers to sell bills of exchange to private individuals at a moderate\npremium. Not being a corporate body, having no stock holders, debtors,\nor property, and but few officers, it would not be obnoxious to the\nconstitutional objections which are urged against the present bank; and\nhaving no means to operate on the hopes, fears, or interests of large\nmasses of the community, it would be shorn of the influence which makes\nthat bank formidable. The States would be strengthened by having in\ntheir hands the means of furnishing the local paper currency through\ntheir own banks, while the Bank of the United States, though issuing no\npaper, would check the issues of the State banks by taking their notes\nin deposit and for exchange only so long as they continue to be\nredeemed with specie. In times of public emergency the capacities of\nsuch an institution might be enlarged by legislative provisions.These suggestions are made not so much as a recommendation as with a\nview of calling the attention of Congress to the possible modifications\nof a system which can not continue to exist in its present form without\noccasional collisions with the local authorities and perpetual\napprehensions and discontent on the part of the States and the people.In conclusion, fellow citizens, allow me to invoke in behalf of your\ndeliberations that spirit of conciliation and disinterestedness which\nis the gift of patriotism. Under an over-ruling and merciful Providence\nthe agency of this spirit has thus far been signalized in the\nprosperity and glory of our beloved country. May its influence be\neternal.",
