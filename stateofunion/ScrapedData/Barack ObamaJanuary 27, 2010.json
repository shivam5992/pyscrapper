    "speech": "Madame Speaker, Vice President Biden, Members of Congress, distinguished\nguests, and fellow Americans:Our Constitution declares that from time to time, the President shall give to\nCongress information about the state of our union. For two hundred and twenty\nyears, our leaders have fulfilled this duty. They have done so during periods\nof prosperity and tranquility. And they have done so in the midst of war and\ndepression; at moments of great strife and great struggle.It's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was\ninevitable -- that America was always destined to succeed. But when the Union\nwas turned back at Bull Run and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach,\nvictory was very much in doubt. When the market crashed on Black Tuesday and\ncivil rights marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday, the future was anything\nbut certain. These were times that tested the courage of our convictions, and\nthe strength of our union. And despite all our divisions and disagreements;\nour hesitations and our fears; America prevailed because we chose to move\nforward as one nation, and one people.Again, we are tested. And again, we must answer history's call.One year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by severe\nrecession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government\ndeeply in debt. Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we\ndid not act, we might face a second depression. So we acted -- immediately and\naggressively. And one year later, the worst of the storm has passed.But the devastation remains. One in ten Americans still cannot find work. Many\nbusinesses have shuttered. Home values have declined. Small towns and rural\ncommunities have been hit especially hard. For those who had already known\npoverty, life has become that much harder.This recession has also compounded the burdens that America's families have\nbeen dealing with for decades -- the burden of working harder and longer for\nless; of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college.So I know the anxieties that are out there right now. They're not new. These\nstruggles are the reason I ran for President. These struggles are what I've\nwitnessed for years in places like Elkhart, Indiana and Galesburg, Illinois. I\nhear about them in the letters that I read each night. The toughest to read\nare those written by children -- asking why they have to move from their home,\nor when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work.For these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough. Some\nare frustrated; some are angry. They don't understand why it seems like bad\nbehavior on Wall Street is rewarded but hard work on Main Street isn't; or why\nWashington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems. They are\ntired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness. They know we\ncan't afford it. Not now.So we face big and difficult challenges. And what the American people hope --\nwhat they deserve -- is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work\nthrough our differences; to overcome the numbing weight of our politics. For\nwhile the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different\nstories and different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same. The\naspirations they hold are shared. A job that pays the bills. A chance to get\nahead. Most of all, the ability to give their children a better life.You know what else they share? They share a stubborn resilience in the face of\nadversity. After one of the most difficult years in our history, they remain\nbusy building cars and teaching kids; starting businesses and going back to\nschool. They're coaching little league and helping their neighbors. As one\nwoman wrote me, \"We are strained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged.\"It is because of this spirit -- this great decency and great strength -- that\nI have never been more hopeful about America's future than I am tonight.\nDespite our hardships, our union is strong. We do not give up. We do not quit.\nWe do not allow fear or division to break our spirit. In this new decade, it's\ntime the American people get a government that matches their decency; that\nembodies their strength.And tonight, I'd like to talk about how together, we can deliver on that\npromise.It begins with our economy.Our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that\nhelped cause this crisis. It was not easy to do. And if there's one thing that\nhas unified Democrats and Republicans, it's that we all hated the bank\nbailout. I hated it. You hated it. It was about as popular as a root canal.But when I ran for President, I promised I wouldn't just do what was popular\n-- I would do what was necessary. And if we had allowed the meltdown of the\nfinancial system, unemployment might be double what it is today. More\nbusinesses would certainly have closed. More homes would have surely been\nlost.So I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial\nrescue program. And when we took the program over, we made it more transparent\nand accountable. As a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we have\nrecovered most of the money we spent on the banks.To recover the rest, I have proposed a fee on the biggest banks. I know Wall\nStreet isn't keen on this idea, but if these firms can afford to hand out big\nbonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who\nrescued them in their time of need.As we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy\ngrowing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help Americans who had\nbecome unemployed.That's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18\nmillion Americans; made health insurance 65% cheaper for families who get\ntheir coverage through COBRA; and passed 25 different tax cuts.Let me repeat: we cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95% of working families. We cut\ntaxes for small businesses. We cut taxes for first-time homebuyers. We cut\ntaxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut taxes for 8\nmillion Americans paying for college. As a result, millions of Americans had\nmore to spend on gas, and food, and other necessities, all of which helped\nbusinesses keep more workers. And we haven't raised income taxes by a single\ndime on a single person. Not a single dime.Because of the steps we took, there are about two million Americans working\nright now who would otherwise be unemployed. 200,000 work in construction and\nclean energy. 300,000 are teachers and other education workers. Tens of\nthousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, and first responders.\nAnd we are on track to add another one and a half million jobs to this total\nby the end of the year.The plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is\nthe Recovery Act. That's right -- the Recovery Act, also known as the Stimulus\nBill. Economists on the left and the right say that this bill has helped saved\njobs and avert disaster. But you don't have to take their word for it.Talk to the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because\nof the Recovery Act.Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be\nskeptical about the Recovery Act, until he had to add two more work shifts\njust because of the business it created.Talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in\nthe last week of school that because of the Recovery Act, she wouldn't be laid\noff after all.There are stories like this all across America. And after two years of\nrecession, the economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started to gain\nback some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly\nsome are starting to hire again.But I realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men\nand women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next\npaycheck will come from; who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing\nin response. That is why jobs must be our number one focus in 2010, and that\nis why I am calling for a new jobs bill tonight.Now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's\nbusinesses. But government can create the conditions necessary for businesses\nto expand and hire more workers.We should start where most new jobs do -- in small businesses, companies that\nbegin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, or a worker decides its\ntime she became her own boss.Through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the\nrecession and are ready to grow. But when you talk to small business owners in\nplaces like Allentown, Pennsylvania or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even\nthough banks on Wall Street are lending again, they are mostly lending to\nbigger companies. But financing remains difficult for small business owners\nacross the country.So tonight, I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street\nbanks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the\ncredit they need to stay afloat. I am also proposing a new small business tax\ncredit -- one that will go to over one million small businesses who hire new\nworkers or raise wages. While we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital\ngains taxes on small business investment; and provide a tax incentive for all\nbusinesses, large and small, to invest in new plants and equipment.Next, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of\ntomorrow. From the first railroads to the interstate highway system, our\nnation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China\nshould have the fastest trains, or the new factories that manufacture clean\nenergy products.Tomorrow, I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a\nnew high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act. There are projects like\nthat all across this country that will create jobs and help our nation move\ngoods, services, and information. We should put more Americans to work\nbuilding clean energy facilities, and give rebates to Americans who make their\nhomes more energy efficient, which supports clean energy jobs. And to\nencourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it's time to\nfinally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and\ngive those tax breaks to companies that create jobs in the United States of\nAmerica.The House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps. As the\nfirst order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same. People\nare out of work. They are hurting. They need our help. And I want a jobs bill\non my desk without delay.But the truth is, these steps still won't make up for the seven million jobs\nwe've lost over the last two years. The only way to move to full employment is\nto lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth, and finally address the\nproblems that America's families have confronted for years.We cannot afford another so-called economic \"expansion\" like the one from last\ndecade -- what some call the \"lost decade\" -- where jobs grew more slowly than\nduring any prior expansion; where the income of the average American household\ndeclined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs; where\nprosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation.From the day I took office, I have been told that addressing our larger\nchallenges is too ambitious -- that such efforts would be too contentious,\nthat our political system is too gridlocked, and that we should just put\nthings on hold for awhile.For those who make these claims, I have one simple question:How long should we wait? How long should America put its future on hold?You see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the\nproblems have grown worse. Meanwhile, China's not waiting to revamp its\neconomy. Germany's not waiting. India's not waiting. These nations aren't\nstanding still. These nations aren't playing for second place. They're putting\nmore emphasis on math and science. They're rebuilding their infrastructure.\nThey are making serious investments in clean energy because they want those\njobs.Well I do not accept second-place for the United States of America. As hard as\nit may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may be, it's time\nto get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth.One place to start is serious financial reform. Look, I am not interested in\npunishing banks, I'm interested in protecting our economy. A strong, healthy\nfinancial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create\nnew jobs. It channels the savings of families into investments that raise\nincomes. But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness\nthat nearly brought down our entire economy.We need to make sure consumers and middle-class families have the information\nthey need to make financial decisions. We can't allow financial institutions,\nincluding those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole\neconomy.The House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes. And\nthe lobbyists are already trying to kill it. Well, we cannot let them win this\nfight. And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real\nreform, I will send it back.Next, we need to encourage American innovation. Last year, we made the largest\ninvestment in basic research funding in history -- an investment that could\nlead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells\nbut leaves healthy ones untouched. And no area is more ripe for such\ninnovation than energy. You can see the results of last year's investment in\nclean energy -- in the North Carolina company that will create 1200 jobs\nnationwide helping to make advanced batteries; or in the California business\nthat will put 1,000 people to work making solar panels.But to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more\nefficiency, more incentives. That means building a new generation of safe,\nclean nuclear power plants in this country. It means making tough decisions\nabout opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development. It means\ncontinued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies. And\nyes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives\nthat will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America.I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year. This year, I am\neager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate. I know there have\nbeen questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy;\nand I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific\nevidence on climate change. But even if you doubt the evidence, providing\nincentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do\nfor our future -- because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will\nbe the nation that leads the global economy. And America must be that nation.Third, we need to export more of our goods. Because the more products we make\nand sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America.\nSo tonight, we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next five\nyears, an increase that will support two million jobs in America. To help meet\nthis goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers\nand small businesses increase their exports, and reform export controls\nconsistent with national security.We have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are. If\nAmerica sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will\nlose the chance to create jobs on our shores. But realizing those benefits\nalso means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the\nrules. And that's why we will continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that\nopens global markets, and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia\nand with key partners like South Korea, Panama, and Colombia.Fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people.This year, we have broken through the stalemate between left and right by\nlaunching a national competition to improve our schools. The idea here is\nsimple: instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. Instead of\nfunding the status quo, we only invest in reform -- reform that raises student\nachievement, inspires students to excel in math and science, and turns around\nfailing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans, from rural\ncommunities to inner-cities. In the 21st century, one of the best anti-poverty\nprograms is a world-class education. In this country, the success of our\nchildren cannot depend more on where they live than their potential.When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with\nCongress to expand these reforms to all fifty states. Still, in this economy,\na high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job. I urge the Senate to\nfollow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges,\nwhich are a career pathway to the children of so many working families. To\nmake college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted\ntaxpayer-subsidies that go to banks for student loans. Instead, let's take\nthat money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for four years of college\nand increase Pell Grants. And let's tell another one million students that\nwhen they graduate, they will be required to pay only ten percent of their\nincome on student loans, and all of their debt will be forgiven after twenty\nyears -- and forgiven after ten years if they choose a career in public\nservice. Because in the United States of America, no one should go broke\nbecause they chose to go to college. And it's time for colleges and\nuniversities to get serious about cutting their own costs -- because they too\nhave a responsibility to help solve this problem.Now, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the\nmiddle-class. That's why last year I asked Vice President Biden to chair a\ntask force on Middle-Class Families. That's why we're nearly doubling the\nchild care tax credit, and making it easier to save for retirement by giving\nevery worker access to a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for\nthose who start a nest egg. That's why we're working to lift the value of a\nfamily's single largest investment -- their home. The steps we took last year\nto shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out\nnew loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments. This year, we\nwill step up re-financing so that homeowners can move into more affordable\nmortgages. And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle-class families\nthat we still need health insurance reform.Now let's be clear -- I did not choose to tackle this issue to get some\nlegislative victory under my belt. And by now it should be fairly obvious that\nI didn't take on health care because it was good politics.I took on health care because of the stories I've heard from Americans with\npre-existing conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage; patients\nwho've been denied coverage; and families -- even those with insurance -- who\nare just one illness away from financial ruin.After nearly a century of trying, we are closer than ever to bringing more\nsecurity to the lives of so many Americans. The approach we've taken would\nprotect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry. It\nwould give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an\naffordable health care plan in a competitive market. It would require every\ninsurance plan to cover preventive care. And by the way, I want to acknowledge\nour First Lady, Michelle Obama, who this year is creating a national movement\nto tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make our kids healthier.Our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep\ntheir doctor and their plan. It would reduce costs and premiums for millions\nof families and businesses. And according to the Congressional Budget Office\n-- the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official\nscorekeeper for Congress -- our approach would bring down the deficit by as\nmuch as $1 trillion over the next two decades.Still, this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more\nskeptical people became. I take my share of the blame for not explaining it\nmore clearly to the American people. And I know that with all the lobbying and\nhorse-trading, this process left most Americans wondering what's in it for\nthem.But I also know this problem is not going away. By the time I'm finished\nspeaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance.\nMillions will lose it this year. Our deficit will grow. Premiums will go up.\nPatients will be denied the care they need. Small business owners will\ncontinue to drop coverage altogether. I will not walk away from these\nAmericans, and neither should the people in this chamber.As temperatures cool, I want everyone to take another look at the plan we've\nproposed. There's a reason why many doctors, nurses, and health care experts\nwho know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the\nstatus quo. But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will\nbring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen\nMedicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know. Here's\nwhat I ask of Congress, though: Do not walk away from reform. Not now. Not\nwhen we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the job\nfor the American people.Now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to\ndig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves. It's a\nchallenge that makes all others that much harder to solve, and one that's been\nsubject to a lot of political posturing.So let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record\nstraight. At the beginning of the last decade, America had a budget surplus of\nover $200 billion. By the time I took office, we had a one year deficit of\nover $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade.\nMost of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an\nexpensive prescription drug program. On top of that, the effects of the\nrecession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget. That was before I walked in\nthe door.Now if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more\nthan to start bringing down the deficit. But we took office amid a crisis, and\nour efforts to prevent a second Depression have added another $1 trillion to\nour national debt.I am absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do. But families across\nthe country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The federal\ngovernment should do the same. So tonight, I'm proposing specific steps to pay\nfor the $1 trillion that it took to rescue the economy last year.Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three\nyears. Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and\nSocial Security will not be affected. But all other discretionary government\nprograms will. Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to\ninvest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't. And if I have to enforce\nthis discipline by veto, I will.We will continue to go through the budget line by line to eliminate programs\nthat we can't afford and don't work. We've already identified $20 billion in\nsavings for next year. To help working families, we will extend our\nmiddle-class tax cuts. But at a time of record deficits, we will not continue\ntax cuts for oil companies, investment fund managers, and those making over\n$250,000 a year. We just can't afford it.Now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we will still face the\nmassive deficit we had when I took office. More importantly, the cost of\nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will continue to skyrocket. That's why\nI've called for a bipartisan, Fiscal Commission, modeled on a proposal by\nRepublican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad. This can't be one of those\nWashington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solved a problem. The Commission\nwill have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline.\nYesterday, the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission.\nSo I will issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward, because I\nrefuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans. And when\nthe vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that\nwas a big reason why we had record surpluses in the 1990s.I know that some in my own party will argue that we cannot address the deficit\nor freeze government spending when so many are still hurting. I agree, which\nis why this freeze will not take effect until next year, when the economy is\nstronger. But understand -- if we do not take meaningful steps to rein in our\ndebt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and\njeopardize our recovery -- all of which could have an even worse effect on our\njob growth and family incomes.From some on the right, I expect we'll hear a different argument  that if we\njust make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts for wealthier\nAmericans, eliminate more regulations, and maintain the status quo on health\ncare, our deficits will go away. The problem is, that's what we did for eight\nyears. That's what helped lead us into this crisis. It's what helped lead to\nthese deficits. And we cannot do it again.Rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for\ndecades, it's time to try something new. Let's invest in our people without\nleaving them a mountain of debt. Let's meet our responsibility to the citizens\nwho sent us here. Let's try common sense.To do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars\nright now. We face a deficit of trust  deep and corrosive doubts about how\nWashington works that have been growing for years. To close that credibility\ngap we must take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to end the\noutsized influence of lobbyists; to do our work openly; and to give our people\nthe government they deserve.That's what I came to Washington to do. That's why  for the first time in\nhistory  my Administration posts our White House visitors online. And that's\nwhy we've excluded lobbyists from policy-making jobs or seats on federal\nboards and commissions.But we can't stop there. It's time to require lobbyists to disclose each\ncontact they make on behalf of a client with my Administration or Congress.\nAnd it's time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to\ncandidates for federal office. Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century\nof law to open the floodgates for special interests  including foreign\ncorporations  to spend without limit in our elections. Well I don't think\nAmerican elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests,\nor worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people,\nand that's why I'm urging Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps\nto right this wrong.I'm also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform. You\nhave trimmed some of this spending and embraced some meaningful change. But\nrestoring the public trust demands more. For example, some members of Congress\npost some earmark requests online. Tonight, I'm calling on Congress to publish\nall earmark requests on a single website before there's a vote so that the\nAmerican people can see how their money is being spent.Of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also reform how\nwe work with one another.Now, I am not nave. I never thought the mere fact of my election would usher\nin peace, harmony, and some post-partisan era. I knew that both parties have\nfed divisions that are deeply entrenched. And on some issues, there are simply\nphilosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. These\ndisagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national\npriorities and our national security, have been taking place for over two\nhundred years. They are the very essence of our democracy.But what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is\nElection Day. We cannot wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to\nsee who can get the most embarrassing headlines about their opponent  a belief\nthat if you lose, I win. Neither party should delay or obstruct every single\nbill just because they can. The confirmation of well-qualified public servants\nshould not be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual\nSenators. Washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no\nmatter how false, is just part of the game. But it is precisely such politics\nthat has stopped either party from helping the American people. Worse yet, it\nis sowing further division among our citizens and further distrust in our\ngovernment.So no, I will not give up on changing the tone of our politics. I know it's an\nelection year. And after last week, it is clear that campaign fever has come\neven earlier than usual. But we still need to govern. To Democrats, I would\nremind you that we still have the largest majority in decades, and the people\nexpect us to solve some problems, not run for the hills. And if the Republican\nleadership is going to insist that sixty votes in the Senate are required to\ndo any business at all in this town, then the responsibility to govern is now\nyours as well. Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics,\nbut it's not leadership. We were sent here to serve our citizens, not our\nambitions. So let's show the American people that we can do it together. This\nweek, I'll be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans. And I would like\nto begin monthly meetings with both the Democratic and Republican leadership.\nI know you can't wait.Throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than our\nsecurity. Sadly, some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated. We can\nargue all we want about who's to blame for this, but I am not interested in\nre-litigating the past. I know that all of us love this country. All of us are\ncommitted to its defense. So let's put aside the schoolyard taunts about who\nis tough. Let's reject the false choice between protecting our people and\nupholding our values. Let's leave behind the fear and division, and do what it\ntakes to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future  for America and\nthe world.That is the work we began last year. Since the day I took office, we have\nrenewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our nation. We have made\nsubstantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that\nthreatened to take American lives. We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed\nby the failed Christmas attack, with better airline security, and swifter\naction on our intelligence. We have prohibited torture and strengthened\npartnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula. And in\nthe last year, hundreds of Al Qaeda's fighters and affiliates, including many\nsenior leaders, have been captured or killed  far more than in 2008.In Afghanistan, we are increasing our troops and training Afghan Security\nForces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011, and our troops can\nbegin to come home. We will reward good governance, reduce corruption, and\nsupport the rights of all Afghans  men and women alike. We are joined by\nallies and partners who have increased their own commitment, and who will come\ntogether tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common purpose. There will be\ndifficult days ahead. But I am confident we will succeed.As we take the fight to al Qaeda, we are responsibly leaving Iraq to its\npeople. As a candidate, I promised that I would end this war, and that is what\nI am doing as President. We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by\nthe end of this August. We will support the Iraqi government as they hold\nelections, and continue to partner with the Iraqi people to promote regional\npeace and prosperity. But make no mistake: this war is ending, and all of our\ntroops are coming home.Tonight, all of our men and women in uniform -- in Iraq, Afghanistan, and\naround the world  must know that they have our respect, our gratitude, and our\nfull support. And just as they must have the resources they need in war, we\nall have a responsibility to support them when they come home. That is why we\nmade the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades. That is why\nwe are building a 21st century VA. And that is why Michelle has joined with\nJill Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families.Even as we prosecute two wars, we are also confronting perhaps the greatest\ndanger to the American people  the threat of nuclear weapons. I have embraced\nthe vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that\nreverses the spread of these weapons, and seeks a world without them. To\nreduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the United\nStates and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest-reaching arms\ncontrol treaty in nearly two decades. And at April's Nuclear Security Summit,\nwe will bring forty-four nations together behind a clear goal: securing all\nvulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years, so that they\nnever fall into the hands of terrorists.These diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those\nnations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of these\nweapons. That is why North Korea now faces increased isolation, and stronger\nsanctions  sanctions that are being vigorously enforced. That is why the\ninternational community is more united, and the Islamic Republic of Iran is\nmore isolated. And as Iran's leaders continue to ignore their obligations,\nthere should be no doubt: they, too, will face growing consequences.That is the leadership that we are providing  engagement that advances the\ncommon security and prosperity of all people. We are working through the G-20\nto sustain a lasting global recovery. We are working with Muslim communities\naround the world to promote science, education and innovation. We have gone\nfrom a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change. We are\nhelping developing countries to feed themselves, and continuing the fight\nagainst HIV/AIDS. And we are launching a new initiative that will give us the\ncapacity to respond faster and more effectively to bio-terrorism or an\ninfectious disease  a plan that will counter threats at home, and strengthen\npublic health abroad.As we have for over sixty years, America takes these actions because our\ndestiny is connected to those beyond our shores. But we also do it because it\nis right. That is why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 Americans are\nworking with many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild.\nThat is why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan;\nwe support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of Iran;\nand we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in Guinea. For\nAmerica must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity.Abroad, America's greatest source of strength has always been our ideals. The\nsame is true at home. We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on\nthe promise enshrined in our Constitution: the notion that we are all created\nequal, that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the\nlaw you should be protected by it; that if you adhere to our common values you\nshould be treated no different than anyone else.We must continually renew this promise. My Administration has a Civil Rights\nDivision that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment\ndiscrimination. We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes\ndriven by hate. This year, I will work with Congress and our military to\nfinally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the\ncountry they love because of who they are. We are going to crack down on\nviolations of equal pay laws  so that women get equal pay for an equal day's\nwork. And we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system \nto secure our borders, enforce our laws, and ensure that everyone who plays by\nthe rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nations.In the end, it is our ideals, our values, that built America  values that\nallowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the\nglobe; values that drive our citizens still. Every day, Americans meet their\nresponsibilities to their families and their employers. Time and again, they\nlend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country. They take pride\nin their labor, and are generous in spirit. These aren't Republican values or\nDemocratic values they're living by; business values or labor values. They are\nAmerican values.Unfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest\ninstitutions  our corporations, our media, and yes, our government  still\nreflect these same values. Each of these institutions are full of honorable\nmen and women doing important work that helps our country prosper. But each\ntime a CEO rewards himself for failure, or a banker puts the rest of us at\nrisk for his own selfish gain, people's doubts grow. Each time lobbyists game\nthe system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country\nup, we lose faith. The more that TV pundits reduce serious debates into silly\narguments, and big issues into sound bites, our citizens turn away.No wonder there's so much cynicism out there.No wonder there's so much disappointment.I campaigned on the promise of change  change we can believe in, the slogan\nwent. And right now, I know there are many Americans who aren't sure if they\nstill believe we can change  or at least, that I can deliver it.But remember this  I never suggested that change would be easy, or that I can\ndo it alone. Democracy in a nation of three hundred million people can be\nnoisy and messy and complicated. And when you try to do big things and make\nbig changes, it stirs passions and controversy. That's just how it is.Those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe\nand avoid telling hard truths. We can do what's necessary to keep our poll\nnumbers high, and get through the next election instead of doing what's best\nfor the next generation.But I also know this: if people had made that decision fifty years ago or one\nhundred years ago or two hundred years ago, we wouldn't be here tonight. The\nonly reason we are is because generations of Americans were unafraid to do\nwhat was hard; to do what was needed even when success was uncertain; to do\nwhat it took to keep the dream of this nation alive for their children and\ngrandchildren.Our administration has had some political setbacks this year, and some of them\nwere deserved. But I wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared\nto the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year.\nAnd what keeps me going  what keeps me fighting  is that despite all these\nsetbacks, that spirit of determination and optimism  that fundamental decency\nthat has always been at the core of the American people  lives on.It lives on in the struggling small business owner who wrote to me of his\ncompany, \"None of us,\" he said, \"are willing to consider, even slightly, that\nwe might fail.\"It lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her neighbors have\nfelt the pain of recession, \"We are strong. We are resilient. We are\nAmerican.\"It lives on in the 8-year old boy in Louisiana, who just sent me his allowance\nand asked if I would give it to the people of Haiti. And it lives on in all\nthe Americans who've dropped everything to go some place they've never been\nand pull people they've never known from rubble, prompting chants of \"U.S.A.!\nU.S.A.! U.S.A!\" when another life was saved.The spirit that has sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on\nin you, its people.We have finished a difficult year. We have come through a difficult decade.\nBut a new year has come. A new decade stretches before us. We don't quit. I\ndon't quit. Let's seize this moment  to start anew, to carry the dream\nforward, and to strengthen our union once more.Thank you. God Bless You. And God Bless the United States of America.",
