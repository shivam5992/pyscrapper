    "speech": "GENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:Since I last had the privilege of addressing you on the state of the Union\nthe war of nations on the other side of the sea, which had then only begun\nto disclose its portentous proportions, has extended its threatening and\nsinister scope until it has swept within its flame some portion of every\nquarter of the globe, not excepting our own hemisphere, has altered the\nwhole face of international affairs, and now presents a prospect of\nreorganization and reconstruction such as statesmen and peoples have never\nbeen called upon to attempt before.We have stood apart, studiously neutral. It was our manifest duty to do so.\nNot only did we have no part or interest in the policies which seem to have\nbrought the conflict on; it was necessary, if a universal catastrophe was\nto be avoided, that a limit should be set to the sweep of destructive war\nand that some part of the great family of nations should keep the processes\nof peace alive, if only to prevent collective economic ruin and the\nbreakdown throughout the world of the industries by which its populations\nare fed and sustained. It was manifestly the duty of the self-governed\nnations of this hemisphere to redress, if possible, the balance of economic\nloss and confusion in the other, if they could do nothing more. In the day\nof readjustment and recuperation we earnestly hope and believe that they\ncan be of infinite service.In this neutrality, to which they were bidden not only by their separate\nlife and their habitual detachment from the politics of Europe but also by\na clear perception of international duty, the states of America have become\nconscious of a new and more vital community of interest and moral\npartnership in affairs, more clearly conscious of the many common\nsympathies and interests and duties which bid them stand together.There was a time in the early days of our own great nation and of the\nrepublics fighting their way to independence in Central and South America\nwhen the government of the United States looked upon itself as in some sort\nthe guardian of the republics to the South of her as against any\nencroachments or efforts at political control from the other side of the\nwater; felt it its duty to play the part even without invitation from them;\nand I think that we can claim that the task was undertaken with a true and\ndisinterested enthusiasm for the freedom of the Americas and the unmolested\nSelf-government of her independent peoples. But it was always difficult to\nmaintain such a role without offense to the pride of the peoples whose\nfreedom of action we sought to protect, and without provoking serious\nmisconceptions of our motives, and every thoughtful man of affairs must\nwelcome the altered circumstances of the new day in whose light we now\nstand, when there is no claim of guardianship or thought of wards but,\ninstead, a full and honorable association as of partners between ourselves\nand our neighbors, in the interest of all America, north and south. Our\nconcern for the independence and prosperity of the states of Central and\nSouth America is not altered. We retain unabated the spirit that has\ninspired us throughout the whole life of our government and which was so\nfrankly put into words by President Monroe. We still mean always to make a\ncommon cause of national independence and of political liberty in America.\nBut that purpose is now better understood so far as it concerns ourselves.\nIt is known not to be a selfish purpose. It is known to have in it no\nthought of taking advantage of any government in this hemisphere or playing\nits political fortunes for our own benefit. All the governments of America\nstand, so far as we are concerned, upon a footing of genuine equality and\nunquestioned independence.We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the\ntest. Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we have pursued\nremains to be seen. Her fortunes are in her own hands. But we have at least\nproved that we will not take advantage of her in her distress and undertake\nto impose upon her an order and government of our own choosing. Liberty is\noften a fierce and intractable thing, to which no bounds can be set, and to\nwhich no bounds of a few men's choosing ought ever to be set. Every\nAmerican who has drunk at the true fountains of principle and tradition\nmust subscribe without reservation to the high doctrine of the Virginia\nBill of Rights, which in the great days in which our government was set up\nwas everywhere amongst us accepted as the creed of free men. That doctrine\nis, \"That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit,\nprotection, and security of the people, nation, or community\"; that \"of all\nthe various modes and forms of government, that is the best which is\ncapable of producing the greatest degree of happiness and safety, and is\nmost effectually secured against the danger of maladministration; and that,\nwhen any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these\npurposes, a majority of the community hath an indubitable, inalienable, and\nindefeasible right to reform, alter, or abolish it, in such manner as shall\nbe judged most conducive to the public weal.\" We have unhesitatingly\napplied that heroic principle to the case of Mexico, and now hopefully\nawait the rebirth of the troubled Republic, which had so much of which to\npurge itself and so little sympathy from any outside quarter in the radical\nbut necessary process. We will aid and befriend Mexico, but we will not\ncoerce her; and our course with regard to her ought to be sufficient proof\nto all America that we seek no political suzerainty or selfish control.The moral is, that the states of America are not hostile rivals but\ncooperating friends, and that their growing sense of community or interest,\nalike in matters political and in matters economic, is likely to give them\na new significance as factors in international affairs and in the political\nhistory of the world. It presents them as in a very deep and true sense a\nunit in world affairs, spiritual partners, standing together because\nthinking together, quick with common sympathies and common ideals.\nSeparated they are subject to all the cross currents of the confused\npolitics of a world of hostile rivalries; united in spirit and purpose they\ncannot be disappointed of their peaceful destiny.This is Pan-Americanism. It has none of the spirit of empire in it. It is\nthe embodiment, the effectual embodiment, of the spirit of law and\nindependence and liberty and mutual service.A very notable body of men recently met in the City of Washington, at the\ninvitation and as the guests of this Government, whose deliberations are\nlikely to be looked back to as marking a memorable turning point in the\nhistory of America. They were representative spokesmen of the several\nindependent states of this hemisphere and were assembled to discuss the\nfinancial and commercial relations of the republics of the two continents\nwhich nature and political fortune have so intimately linked together. I\nearnestly recommend to your perusal the reports of their proceedings and of\nthe actions of their committees. You will get from them, I think, a fresh\nconception of the ease and intelligence and advantage with which Americans\nof both continents may draw together in practical cooperation and of what\nthe material foundations of this hopeful partnership of interest must\nconsist,-of how we should build them and of how necessary it is that we\nshould hasten their building.There is, I venture to point out, an especial significance just now\nattaching to this whole matter of drawing the Americans together in bonds\nof honorable partnership and mutual advantage because of the economic\nreadjustments which the world must inevitably witness within the next\ngeneration, when peace shall have at last resumed its healthful tasks. In\nthe performance of these tasks I believe the Americas to be destined to\nplay their parts together. I am interested to fix your attention on this\nprospect now because unless you take it within your view and permit the\nfull significance of it to command your thought I cannot find the right\nlight in which to set forth the particular matter that lies at the very\nfont of my whole thought as I address you to-day. I mean national defense.No one who really comprehends the spirit of the great people for whom we\nare appointed to speak can fail to perceive that their passion is for\npeace, their genius best displayed in the practice of the arts of peace.\nGreat democracies are not belligerent. They do not seek or desire war.\nTheir thought is of individual liberty and of the free labor that supports\nlife and the uncensored thought that quickens it. Conquest and dominion are\nnot in our reckoning, or agreeable to our principles. But just because we\ndemand unmolested development and the undisturbed government of our own\nlives upon our own principles of right and liberty, we resent, from\nwhatever quarter it may come, the aggression we ourselves will not\npractice. We insist upon security in prosecuting our self-chosen lines of\nnational development. We do more than that. We demand it also for others.\nWe do not confine our enthusiasm for individual liberty and free national\ndevelopment to the incidents and movements of affairs which affect only\nourselves. We feel it wherever there is a people that tries to walk in\nthese difficult paths of independence and right. From the first we have\nmade common cause with all partisans of liberty on this side the sea, and\nhave deemed it as important that our neighbors should be free from all\noutside domination as that we ourselves should be. We have set America\naside as a whole for the uses of independent nations and political freemen.Out of such thoughts grow all our policies. We regard war merely as a means\nof asserting the rights of a people against aggression. And we are as\nfiercely jealous of coercive or dictatorial power within our own nation as\nof aggression from without. We will not maintain a standing army except for\nuses which are as necessary in times of peace as in times of war; and we\nshall always see to it that our military peace establishment is no larger\nthan is actually and continuously needed for the uses of days in which no\nenemies move against us. But we do believe in a body of free citizens ready\nand sufficient to take care of themselves and of the governments which they\nhave set up to serve them. In our constitutions themselves we have\ncommanded that \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be\ninfringed,\" and our confidence has been that our safety in times of danger\nwould lie in the rising of the nation to take care of itself, as the\nfarmers rose at Lexington.But war has never been a mere matter of men and guns. It is a thing of\ndisciplined might. If our citizens are ever to fight effectively upon a\nsudden summons, they must know how modern fighting is done, and what to do\nwhen the summons comes to render themselves immediately available and\nimmediately effective. And the government must be their servant in this\nmatter, must supply them with the training they need to take care of\nthemselves and of it. The military arm of their government, which they will\nnot allow to direct them, they may properly use to serve them and make\ntheir independence secure,-and not their own independence merely but the\nrights also of those with whom they have made common cause, should they\nalso be put in jeopardy. They must be fitted to play the great role in the\nworld, and particularly in this hemisphere, for which they are qualified by\nprinciple and by chastened ambition to play.It is with these ideals in mind that the plans of the Department of War for\nmore adequate national defense were conceived which will be laid before\nyou, and which I urge you to sanction and put into effect as soon as they\ncan be properly scrutinized and discussed. They seem to me the essential\nfirst steps, and they seem to me for the present sufficient.They contemplate an increase of the standing force of the regular army from\nits present strength of five thousand and twenty-three officers and one\nhundred and two thousand nine hundred and eighty-five enlisted men of all\nservices to a strength of seven thousand one hundred and thirty-six\nofficers and one hundred and thirty-four thousand seven hundred and seven\nenlisted men, or 141,843, all told, all services, rank and file, by the\naddition of fifty-two companies of coast artillery, fifteen companies of\nengineers, ten regiments of infantry, four regiments of field artillery,\nand four aero squadrons, besides seven hundred and fifty officers required\nfor a great variety of extra service, especially the all important duty of\ntraining the citizen force of which I shall presently speak, seven hundred\nand ninety-two noncommissioned officers for service in drill, recruiting\nand the like, and the necessary quota of enlisted men for the Quartermaster\nCorps, the Hospital Corps, the Ordnance Department, and other similar\nauxiliary services. These are the additions necessary to render the army\nadequate for its present duties, duties which it has to perform not only\nupon our own continental coasts and borders and at our interior army posts,\nbut also in the Philippines, in the Hawaiian Islands, at the Isthmus, and\nin Porto Rico.By way of making the country ready to assert some part of its real power\npromptly and upon a larger scale, should occasion arise, the plan also\ncontemplates supplementing the army by a force of four hundred thousand\ndisciplined citizens, raised in increments of one hundred and thirty-three\nthousand a year throughout a period of three years. This it is proposed to\ndo by a process of enlistment under which the serviceable men of the\ncountry would be asked to bind themselves to serve with the colors for\npurposes of training for short periods throughout three years, and to come\nto the colors at call at any time throughout an additional \"furlough\"\nperiod of three years. This force of four hundred thousand men would be\nprovided with personal accoutrements as fast as enlisted and their\nequipment for the field made ready to be supplied at any time. They would\nbe assembled for training at stated intervals at convenient places in\nassociation with suitable units of the regular army. Their period of annual\ntraining would not necessarily exceed two months in the year.It would depend upon the patriotic feeling of the younger men of the\ncountry whether they responded to such a call to service or not. It would\ndepend upon the patriotic spirit of the employers of the country whether\nthey made it possible for the younger men in their employ to respond under\nfavorable conditions or not. I, for one, do not doubt the patriotic\ndevotion either of our young men or of those who give them\nemployment,--those for whose benefit and protection they would in fact\nenlist. I would look forward to the success of such an experiment with\nentire confidence.At least so much by way of preparation for defense seems to me to be\nabsolutely imperative now. We cannot do less.The programme which will be laid before you by the Secretary of the Navy is\nsimilarly conceived. It involves only a shortening of the time within which\nplans long matured shall be carried out; but it does make definite and\nexplicit a programme which has heretofore been only implicit, held in the\nminds of the Committees on Naval Affairs and disclosed in the debates of\nthe two Houses but nowhere formulated or formally adopted. It seems to me\nvery clear that it will be to the advantage of the country for the Congress\nto adopt a comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of\nstrength and efficiency and to press that plan to completion within the\nnext five years. We have always looked to the navy of the country as our\nfirst and chief line of defense; we have always seen it to be our manifest\ncourse of prudence to be strong on the seas. Year by year we have been\ncreating a navy which now ranks very high indeed among the navies of the\nmaritime nations. We should now definitely determine how we shall complete\nwhat we have begun, and how soon.The programme to be laid before you contemplates the construction within\nfive years of ten battleships, six battle cruisers, ten scout cruisers,\nfifty destroyers, fifteen fleet submarines, eighty-five coast submarines,\nfour gunboats, one hospital ship, two ammunition ships, two fuel oil ships,\nand one repair ship. It is proposed that of this number we shall the first\nyear provide for the construction of two battleships, two battle cruisers,\nthree scout cruisers, fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines,\ntwenty-five coast submarines, two gunboats, and one hospital ship; the\nsecond year, two battleships, one scout cruiser, ten destroyers, four fleet\nsubmarines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, and one fuel oil ship;\nthe third year, two battleships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers,\nfive destroyers, two fleet sub marines, and fifteen coast submarines; the\nfourth year, two battleships, two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers, ten\ndestroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one ammunition\nship, and one fuel oil ship; and the fifth year, two battleships, one\nbattle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet submarines,\nfifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, one ammunition ship, and one repair\nship.The Secretary of the Navy is asking also for the immediate addition to the\npersonnel of the navy of seven thousand five hundred sailors, twenty-five\nhundred apprentice seamen, and fifteen hundred marines. This increase would\nbe sufficient to care for the ships which are to be completed within the\nfiscal year 1917 and also for the number of men which must be put in\ntraining to man the ships which will be completed early in 1918. It is also\nnecessary that the number of midshipmen at the Naval academy at Annapolis\nshould be increased by at least three hundred in order that the force of\nofficers should be more rapidly added to; and authority is asked to\nappoint, for engineering duties only, approved graduates of engineering\ncolleges, and for service in the aviation corps a certain number of men\ntaken from civil life.If this full programme should be carried out we should have built or\nbuilding in 1921, according to the estimates of survival and standards of\nclassification followed by the General Board of the Department, an\neffective navy consisting of twenty-seven battleships of the first line,\nsix battle cruisers, twenty-five battleships of the second line, ten\narmored cruisers, thirteen scout cruisers, five first class cruisers, three\nsecond class cruisers, ten third class cruisers, one hundred and eight\ndestroyers, eighteen fleet submarines, one hundred and fifty-seven coast\nsubmarines, six monitors, twenty gunboats, four supply ships, fifteen fuel\nships, four transports, three tenders to torpedo vessels, eight vessels of\nspecial types, and two ammunition ships. This would be a navy fitted to our\nneeds and worthy of our traditions.But armies and instruments of war are only part of what has to be\nconsidered if we are to provide for the supreme matter of national\nself-sufficiency and security in all its aspects. There are other great\nmatters which will be thrust upon our attention whether we will or not.\nThere is, for example, a very pressing question of trade and shipping\ninvolved in this great problem of national adequacy. It is necessary for\nmany weighty reasons of national efficiency and development that we should\nhave a great merchant marine. The great merchant fleet we once used to make\nus rich, that great body of sturdy sailors who used to carry our flag into\nevery sea, and who were the pride and often the bulwark of the nation, we\nhave almost driven out of existence by inexcusable neglect and indifference\nand by a hopelessly blind and provincial policy of so-called economic\nprotection. It is high time we repaired our mistake and resumed our\ncommercial independence on the seas.For it is a question of independence. If other nations go to war or seek to\nhamper each other's commerce, our merchants, it seems, are at their mercy,\nto do with as they please. We must use their ships, and use them as they\ndetermine. We have not ships enough of our own. We cannot handle our own\ncommerce on the seas. Our independence is provincial, and is only on land\nand within our own borders. We are not likely to be permitted to use even\nthe ships of other nations in rivalry of their own trade, and are without\nmeans to extend our commerce even where the doors are wide open and our\ngoods desired. Such a situation is not to be endured. It is of capital\nimportance not only that the United States should be its own carrier on the\nseas and enjoy the economic independence which only an adequate merchant\nmarine would give it, but also that the American hemisphere as a whole\nshould enjoy a like independence and self-sufficiency, if it is not to be\ndrawn into the tangle of European affairs. Without such independence the\nwhole question of our political unity and self-determination is very\nseriously clouded and complicated indeed.Moreover, we can develop no true or effective American policy without ships\nof our own,--not ships of war, but ships of peace, carrying goods and\ncarrying much more: creating friendships and rendering indispensable\nservices to all interests on this side the water. They must move constantly\nback and forth between the Americas. They are the only shuttles that can\nweave the delicate fabric of sympathy, comprehension, confidence, and\nmutual dependence in which we wish to clothe our policy of America for\nAmericans.The task of building up an adequate merchant marine for America private\ncapital must ultimately undertake and achieve, as it has undertaken and\nachieved every other like task amongst us in the past, with admirable\nenterprise, intelligence, and vigor; and it seems to me a manifest dictate\nof wisdom that we should promptly remove every legal obstacle that may\nstand in the way of this much to be desired revival of our old independence\nand should facilitate in every possible way the building, purchase, and\nAmerican registration of ships. But capital cannot accomplish this great\ntask of a sudden. It must embark upon it by degrees, as the opportunities\nof trade develop. Something must be done at once; done to open routes and\ndevelop opportunities where they are as yet undeveloped; done to open the\narteries of trade where the currents have not yet learned to\nrun,-especially between the two American continents, where they are,\nsingularly enough, yet to be created and quickened; and it is evident that\nonly the government can undertake such beginnings and assume the initial\nfinancial risks. When the risk has passed and private capital begins to\nfind its way in sufficient abundance into these new channels, the\ngovernment may withdraw. But it cannot omit to begin. It should take the\nfirst steps, and should take them at once. Our goods must not lie piled up\nat our ports and stored upon side tracks in freight cars which are daily\nneeded on the roads; must not be left without means of transport to any\nforeign quarter. We must not await the permission of foreign ship-owners\nand foreign governments to send them where we will.With a view to meeting these pressing necessities of our commerce and\navailing ourselves at the earliest possible moment of the present\nunparalleled opportunity of linking the two Americas together in bonds of\nmutual interest and service, an opportunity which may never return again if\nwe miss it now, proposals will be made to the present Congress for the\npurchase or construction of ships to be owned and directed by the\ngovernment similar to those made to the last Congress, but modified in some\nessential particulars. I recommend these proposals to you for your prompt\nacceptance with the more confidence because every month that has elapsed\nsince the former proposals were made has made the necessity for such action\nmore and more manifestly imperative. That need was then foreseen; it is now\nacutely felt and everywhere realized by those for whom trade is waiting but\nwho can find no conveyance for their goods. I am not so much interested in\nthe particulars of the programme as I am in taking immediate advantage of\nthe great opportunity which awaits us if we will but act in this emergency.\nIn this matter, as in all others, a spirit of common counsel should\nprevail, and out of it should come an early solution of this pressing\nproblem.There is another matter which seems to me to be very intimately associated\nwith the question of national safety and preparation for defense. That is\nour policy towards the Philippines and the people of Porto Rico. Our\ntreatment of them and their attitude towards us are manifestly of the first\nconsequence in the development of our duties in the world and in getting a\nfree hand to perform those duties. We must be free from every unnecessary\nburden or embarrassment; and there is no better way to be clear of\nembarrassment than to fulfil our promises and promote the interests of\nthose dependent on us to the utmost. Bills for the alteration and reform of\nthe government of the Philippines and for rendering fuller political\njustice to the people of Porto Rico were submitted to the sixty-third\nCongress. They will be submitted also to you. I need not particularize\ntheir details. You are most of you already familiar with them. But I do\nrecommend them to your early adoption with the sincere conviction that\nthere are few measures you could adopt which would more serviceably clear\nthe way for the great policies by which we wish to make good, now and\nalways, our right to lead in enterprises of peace and good will and\neconomic and political freedom.The plans for the armed forces of the nation which I have outlined, and for\nthe general policy of adequate preparation for mobilization and defense,\ninvolve of course very large additional expenditures of money,-expenditures\nwhich will considerably exceed the estimated revenues of the government. It\nis made my duty by law, whenever the estimates of expenditure exceed the\nestimates of revenue, to call the attention of the Congress to the fact and\nsuggest any means of meeting the deficiency that it may be wise or possible\nfor me to suggest. I am ready to believe that it would be my duty to do so\nin any case; and I feel particularly bound to speak of the matter when it\nappears that the deficiency will arise directly out of the adoption by the\nCongress of measures which I myself urge it to adopt. Allow me, therefore,\nto speak briefly of the present state of the Treasury and of the fiscal\nproblems which the next year will probably disclose.On the thirtieth of June last there was an available balance in the general\nfund of the Treasury Of $104,170,105.78. The total estimated receipts for\nthe year 1916, on the assumption that the emergency revenue measure passed\nby the last Congress will not be extended beyond its present limit, the\nthirty-first of December, 1915, and that the present duty of one cent per\npound on sugar will be discontinued after the first of May, 1916, will be\n$670,365,500. The balance of June last and these estimated revenues come,\ntherefore, to a grand total of $774,535,605-78. The total estimated\ndisbursements for the present fiscal year, including twenty-five millions\nfor the Panama Canal, twelve millions for probable deficiency\nappropriations, and fifty thousand dollars for miscellaneous debt\nredemptions, will be $753,891,000; and the balance in the general fund of\nthe Treasury will be reduced to $20,644,605.78. The emergency revenue act,\nif continued beyond its present time limitation, would produce, during the\nhalf year then remaining, about forty-one millions. The duty of one cent\nper pound on sugar, if continued, would produce during the two months of\nthe fiscal year remaining after the first of May, about fifteen millions.\nThese two sums, amounting together to fifty-six millions, if added to the\nrevenues of the second half of the fiscal year, would yield the Treasury at\nthe end of the year an available balance Of $76,644,605-78.The additional revenues required to carry out the programme of military and\nnaval preparation of which I have spoken, would, as at present estimated,\nbe for the fiscal year, 1917, $93,800,000. Those figures, taken with the\nfigures for the present fiscal year which I have already given, disclose\nour financial problem for the year 1917. Assuming that the taxes imposed by\nthe emergency revenue act and the present duty on sugar are to be\ndiscontinued, and that the balance at the close of the present fiscal year\nwill be only $20,644,605.78, that the disbursements for the Panama Canal\nwill again be about twenty-five millions, and that the additional\nexpenditures for the army and navy are authorized by the Congress, the\ndeficit in the general fund of the Treasury on the thirtieth of June, 1917,\nwill be nearly two hundred and thirty-five millions. To this sum at least\nfifty millions should be added to represent a safe working balance for the\nTreasury, and twelve millions to include the usual deficiency estimates in\n1917; and these additions would make a total deficit of some two hundred\nand ninety-seven millions. If the present taxes should be continued\nthroughout this year and the next, however, there would be a balance in the\nTreasury of some seventy-six and a half millions at the end of the present\nfiscal year, and a deficit at the end of the next year of only some fifty\nmillions, or, reckoning in sixty-two millions for deficiency appropriations\nand a safe Treasury balance at the end of the year, a total deficit of some\none hundred and twelve millions. The obvious moral of the figures is that\nit is a plain counsel of prudence to continue all of the present taxes or\ntheir equivalents, and confine ourselves to the problem of providing one\nhundred and twelve millions of new revenue rather than two hundred and\nninety-seven millions.How shall we obtain the new revenue? We are frequently reminded that there\nare many millions of bonds which the Treasury is authorized under existing\nlaw to sell to reimburse the sums paid out of current revenues for the\nconstruction of the Panama Canal; and it is true that bonds to the amount\nof approximately $222,000,000 are now available for that purpose. Prior to\n1913, $134,631,980 of these bonds had actually been sold to recoup the\nexpenditures at the Isthmus; and now constitute a considerable item of the\npublic debt. But I, for one, do not believe that the people of this country\napprove of postponing the payment of their bills. Borrowing money is\nshort-sighted finance. It can be justified only when permanent things are\nto be accomplished which many generations will certainly benefit by and\nwhich it seems hardly fair that a single generation should pay for. The\nobjects we are now proposing to spend money for cannot be so classified,\nexcept in the sense that everything wisely done may be said to be done in\nthe interest of posterity as well as in our own. It seems to me a clear\ndictate of prudent statesmanship and frank finance that in what we are now,\nI hope, about to undertake we should pay as we go. The people of the\ncountry are entitled to know just what burdens of taxation they are to\ncarry, and to know from the outset, now. The new bills should be paid by\ninternal taxation.To what sources, then, shall we turn? This is so peculiarly a question\nwhich the gentlemen of the House of Representatives are expected under the\nConstitution to propose an answer to that you will hardly expect me to do\nmore than discuss it in very general terms. We should be following an\nalmost universal example of modern governments if we were to draw the\ngreater part or even the whole of the revenues we need from the income\ntaxes. By somewhat lowering the present limits of exemption and the figure\nat which the surtax shall begin to be imposed, and by increasing, step by\nstep throughout the present graduation, the surtax itself, the income taxes\nas at present apportioned would yield sums sufficient to balance the books\nof the Treasury at the end of the fiscal year 1917 without anywhere making\nthe burden unreasonably or oppressively heavy. The precise reckonings are\nfully and accurately set out in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury\nwhich will be immediately laid before you.And there are many additional sources of revenue which can justly be\nresorted to without hampering the industries of the country or putting any\ntoo great charge upon individual expenditure. A tax of one cent per gallon\non gasoline and naphtha would yield, at the present estimated production,\n$10,000,000; a tax of fifty cents per horse power on automobiles and\ninternal explosion engines, $15,000,000; a stamp tax on bank cheques,\nprobably $18,000,000; a tax of twenty-five cents per ton on pig iron,\n$10,000,000; a tax of twenty-five cents per ton on fabricated iron and\nsteel, probably $10,000,000. In a country of great industries like this it\nought to be easy to distribute the burdens of taxation without making them\nanywhere bear too heavily or too exclusively upon any one set of persons or\nundertakings. What is clear is, that the industry of this generation should\npay the bills of this generation.I have spoken to you to-day, Gentlemen, upon a single theme, the thorough\npreparation of the nation to care for its own security and to make sure of\nentire freedom to play the impartial role in this hemisphere and in the\nworld which we all believe to have been providentially assigned to it. I\nhave had in my mind no thought of any immediate or particular danger\narising out of our relations with other nations. We are at peace with all\nthe nations of the world, and there is reason to hope that no question in\ncontroversy between this and other Governments will lead to any serious\nbreach of amicable relations, grave as some differences of attitude and\npolicy have been land may yet turn out to be. I am sorry to say that the\ngravest threats against our national peace and safety have been uttered\nwithin our own borders. There are citizens of the United States, I blush to\nadmit, born under other flags but welcomed under our generous\nnaturalization laws to the full freedom and opportunity of America, who\nhave poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national\nlife; who have sought to bring the authority and good name of our\nGovernment into contempt, to destroy our industries wherever they thought\nit effective for their vindictive purposes to strike at them, and to debase\nour politics to the uses of foreign intrigue. Their number is not great as\ncompared with the whole number of those sturdy hosts by which our nation\nhas been enriched in recent generations out of virile foreign stock; but it\nis great enough to have brought deep disgrace upon us and to have made it\nnecessary that we should promptly make use of processes of law by which we\nmay be purged of their corrupt distempers. America never witnessed anything\nlike this before. It never dreamed it possible that men sworn into its own\ncitizenship, men drawn out of great free stocks such as supplied some of\nthe best and strongest elements of that little, but how heroic, nation that\nin a high day of old staked its very life to free itself from every\nentanglement that had darkened the fortunes of the older nations and set up\na new standard here, that men of such origins and such free choices of\nallegiance would ever turn in malign reaction against the Government and\npeople who had welcomed and nurtured them and seek to make this proud\ncountry once more a hotbed of European passion. A little while ago such a\nthing would have seemed incredible. Because it was incredible we made no\npreparation for it. We would have been almost ashamed to prepare for it, as\nif we were suspicious of ourselves, our own comrades and neighbors! But the\nugly and incredible thing has actually come about and we are without\nadequate federal laws to deal with it. I urge you to enact such laws at the\nearliest possible moment and feel that in doing so I am urging you to do\nnothing less than save the honor and self-respect of the nation. Such\ncreatures of passion, disloyalty, and anarchy must be crushed out. They are\nnot many, but they are infinitely malignant, and the hand of our power\nshould close over them at once. They have formed plots to destroy property,\nthey have entered into conspiracies against the neutrality of the\nGovernment, they have sought to pry into every confidential transaction of\nthe Government in order to serve interests alien to our own. It is possible\nto deal with these things very effectually. I need not suggest the terms in\nwhich they may be dealt with.I wish that it could be said that only a few men, misled by mistaken\nsentiments of allegiance to the governments under which they were born, had\nbeen guilty of disturbing the self-possession and misrepresenting the\ntemper and principles of the country during these days of terrible war,\nwhen it would seem that every man who was truly an American would\ninstinctively make it his duty and his pride to keep the scales of judgment\neven and prove himself a partisan of no nation but his own. But it cannot.\nThere are some men among us, and many resident abroad who, though born and\nbred in the United States and calling themselves Americans, have so\nforgotten themselves and their honor as citizens as to put their passionate\nsympathy with one or the other side in the great European conflict above\ntheir regard for the peace and dignity of the United States. They also\npreach and practice disloyalty. No laws, I suppose, can reach corruptions\nof the mind and heart; but I should not speak of others without also\nspeaking of these and expressing the even deeper humiliation and scorn\nwhich every self-possessed and thoughtfully patriotic American must feel\nwhen he thinks of them and of the discredit they are daily bringing upon\nus.While we speak of the preparation of the nation to make sure of her\nsecurity and her effective power we must not fall into the patent error of\nsupposing that her real strength comes from armaments and mere safeguards\nof written law. It comes, of course, from her people, their energy, their\nsuccess in their undertakings, their free opportunity to use the natural\nresources of our great home land and of the lands outside our continental\nborders which look to us for protection, for encouragement, and for\nassistance in their development; from the organization and freedom and\nvitality of our economic life. The domestic questions which engaged the\nattention of the last Congress are more vital to the nation in this its\ntime of test than at any other time. We cannot adequately make ready for\nany trial of our strength unless we wisely and promptly direct the force of\nour laws into these all-important fields of domestic action. A matter which\nit seems to me we should have very much at heart is the creation of the\nright instrumentalities by which to mobilize our economic resources in any\ntime of national necessity. I take it for granted that I do not need your\nauthority to call into systematic consultation with the directing officers\nof the army and navy men of recognized leadership and ability from among\nour citizens who are thoroughly familiar, for example, with the\ntransportation facilities of the country and therefore competent to advise\nhow they may be coordinated when the need arises, those who can suggest the\nbest way in which to bring about prompt cooperation among the manufacturers\nof the country, should it be necessary, and those who could assist to bring\nthe technical skill of the country to the aid of the Government in the\nsolution of particular problems of defense. I only hope that if I should\nfind it feasible to constitute such an advisory body the Congress would be\nwilling to vote the small sum of money that would be needed to defray the\nexpenses that would probably be necessary to give it the clerical and\nadministrative Machinery with which to do serviceable work.What is more important is, that the industries and resources of the country\nshould be available and ready for mobilization. It is the more imperatively\nnecessary, therefore, that we should promptly devise means for doing what\nwe have not yet done: that we should give intelligent federal aid and\nstimulation to industrial and vocational education, as we have long done in\nthe large field of our agricultural industry; that, at the same time that\nwe safeguard and conserve the natural resources of the country we should\nput them at the disposal of those who will use them promptly and\nintelligently, as was sought to be done in the admirable bills submitted to\nthe last Congress from its committees on the public lands, bills which I\nearnestly recommend in principle to your consideration; that we should put\ninto early operation some provision for rural credits which will add to the\nextensive borrowing facilities already afforded the farmer by the Reserve\nBank Act, adequate instrumentalities by which long credits may be obtained\non land mortgages; and that we should study more carefully than they have\nhitherto been studied the right adaptation of our economic arrangements to\nchanging conditions.Many conditions about which we I-lave repeatedly legislated are being\naltered from decade to decade, it is evident, under our very eyes, and are\nlikely to change even more rapidly and more radically in the days\nimmediately ahead of us, when peace has returned to the world and the\nnations of Europe once more take up their tasks of commerce and industry\nwith the energy of those who must bestir themselves to build anew. Just\nwhat these changes will be no one can certainly foresee or confidently\npredict. There are no calculable, because no stable, elements in the\nproblem. The most we can do is to make certain that we have the necessary\ninstrumentalities of information constantly at our service so that we may\nbe sure that we know exactly what we are dealing with when we come to act,\nif it should be necessary to act at all. We must first certainly know what\nit is that we are seeking to adapt ourselves to. I may ask the privilege of\naddressing you more at length on this important matter a little later in\nyour session.In the meantime may I make this suggestion? The transportation problem is\nan exceedingly serious and pressing one in this country. There has from\ntime to time of late been reason to fear that our railroads would not much\nlonger be able to cope with it successfully, as at present equipped and\ncoordinated I suggest that it would be wise to provide for a commission of\ninquiry to ascertain by a thorough canvass of the whole question whether\nour laws as at present framed and administered are as serviceable as they\nmight be in the solution of the problem. It is obviously a problem that\nlies at the very foundation of our efficiency as a people. Such an inquiry\nought to draw out every circumstance and opinion worth considering and we\nneed to know all sides of the matter if we mean to do anything in the field\nof federal legislation.No one, I am sure, would wish to take any backward step. The regulation of\nthe railways of the country by federal commission has had admirable results\nand has fully justified the hopes and expectations of those by whom the\npolicy of regulation was originally proposed. The question is not what\nshould we undo? It is, whether there is anything else we can do that would\nsupply us with effective means, in the very process of regulation, for\nbettering the conditions under which the railroads are operated and for\nmaking them more useful servants of the country as a whole. It seems to me\nthat it might be the part of wisdom, therefore, before further legislation\nin this field is attempted, to look at the whole problem of coordination\nand efficiency in the full light of a fresh assessment of circumstance and\nopinion, as a guide to dealing with the several parts of it.For what we are seeking now, what in my mind is the single thought of this\nmessage, is national efficiency and security. We serve a great nation. We\nshould serve it in the spirit of its peculiar genius. It is the genius of\ncommon men for self-government, industry, justice, liberty and peace. We\nshould see to it that it lacks no instrument, no facility or vigor of law,\nto make it sufficient to play its part with energy, safety, and assured\nsuccess. In this we are no partisans but heralds and prophets of a new age.",
