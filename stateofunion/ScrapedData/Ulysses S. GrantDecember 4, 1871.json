    "date": "December 4, 1871", 
    "speech": "To the Senate and House of Representatives:In addressing my third annual message to the law-making branch of the\nGovernment it is gratifying to be able to state that during the past year\nsuccess has generally attended the effort to execute all laws found upon\nthe statute books. The policy has been not to inquire into the wisdom of\nlaws already enacted, but to learn their spirit and intent and to enforce\nthem accordingly.The past year has, under a wise Providence, been one of general prosperity\nto the nation. It has, however, been attended with more than usual\nchastisements in the loss of life and property by storm and fire. These\ndisasters have served to call forth the best elements of human nature in\nour country and to develop a friendship for us on the part of foreign\nnations which goes far toward alleviating the distresses occasioned by\nthese calamities. The benevolent, who have so generously shared their means\nwith the victims of these misfortunes, will reap their reward in the\nconsciousness of having performed a noble act and in receiving the grateful\nthanks of men, women, and children whose sufferings they have relieved.The relations of the United States with foreign powers continue to be\nfriendly. The year has been an eventful one in witnessing two great\nnations, speaking one language and having one lineage, settling by peaceful\narbitration disputes of long standing and liable at any time to bring those\nnations into bloody and costly conflict. An example has thus been set\nwhich, if successful in its final issue, may be followed by other civilized\nnations, and finally be the means of returning to productive industry\nmillions of men now maintained to settle the disputes of nations by the\nbayonet and the broadside.I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty alluded to, which has been\nconcluded since the adjournment of Congress with Her Britannic Majesty, and\na copy of the protocols of the conferences of the commissioners by whom it\nwas negotiated. This treaty provides methods for adjusting the questions\npending between the two nations.Various questions are to be adjusted by arbitration. I recommend Congress\nat an early day to make the necessary provision for the tribunal at Geneva\nand for the several commissioners on the part of the United States called\nfor by the treaty.His Majesty the King of Italy, the President of the Swiss Confederation,\nand His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil have each consented, on the joint\nrequest of the two powers, to name an arbiter for the tribunal at Geneva. I\nhave caused my thanks to be suitably expressed for the readiness with which\nthe joint request has been complied with, by the appointment of gentlemen\nof eminence and learning to these important positions.His Majesty the Emperor of Germany has been pleased to comply with the\njoint request of the two Governments, and has consented to act as the\narbitrator of the disputed water boundary between the United States and\nGreat Britain.The contracting parties in the treaty have undertaken to regard as between\nthemselves certain principles of public law, for which the United States\nhave contended from the commencement of their history. They have also\nagreed to bring those principles to the knowledge of the other maritime\npowers and to invite them to accede to them. Negotiations are going on as\nto the form of the note by which the invitation is to be extended to the\nother powers.I recommend the legislation necessary on the part of the United States to\nbring into operation the articles of the treaty relating to the fisheries\nand to the other matters touching the relations of the United States toward\nthe British North American possessions, to become operative so soon as the\nproper legislation shall be had on the part of Great Britain and its\npossessions. It is much to be desired that this legislation may become\noperative before the fishermen of the United States begin to make their\narrangements for the coming season.I have addressed a communication, of which a copy is transmitted herewith,\nto the governors of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan,\nIllinois, and Wisconsin, urging upon the governments of those States,\nrespectively, the necessary action on their part to carry into effect the\nobject of the article of the treaty which contemplates the use of the\ncanals, on either side, connected with the navigation of the lakes and\nrivers forming the boundary, on terms of equality, by the inhabitants of\nboth countries. It is hoped that the importance of the object and the\nbenefits to flow therefrom will secure the speedy approval and legislative\nsanction of the States concerned.I renew the recommendation for an appropriation for determining the true\nposition of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude where it forms the\nboundary between the United States and the British North American\npossessions, between the Lake of the Woods and the summit of the Rocky\nMountains. The early action of Congress on this recommendation would put it\nin the power of the War Department to place a force in the field during the\nnext summer.The resumption of diplomatic relations between France and Germany has\nenabled me to give directions for the withdrawal of the protection extended\nto Germans in France by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the\nUnited States in that country. It is just to add that the delicate duty of\nthis protection has been performed by the minister and the consul-general\nat Paris, and the various consuls in France under the supervision of the\nlatter, with great kindness as well as with prudence and tact. Their course\nhas received the commendation of the German Government, and has wounded no\nsusceptibility of the French.The Government of the Emperor of Germany continues to manifest a friendly\nfeeling toward the United States, and a desire to harmonize with the\nmoderate and just policy which this Government maintains in its relations\nwith Asiatic powers, as well as with the South American Republics. I have\ngiven assurances that the friendly feelings of that Government are fully\nshared by the United States.The ratifications of the consular and naturalization conventions with the\nAustro-Hungarian Empire have been exchanged.I have been officially informed of the annexation of the States of the\nChurch to the Kingdom of Italy, and the removal of the capital of that\nKingdom to Rome. In conformity with the established policy of the United\nStates, I have recognized this change. The ratifications of the new treaty\nof commerce between the United States and Italy have been exchanged. The\ntwo powers have agreed in this treaty that private property at sea shall be\nexempt from capture in case of war between the two powers. The United\nStates have spared no opportunity of incorporating this rule into the\nobligation of nations.The Forty-first Congress, at its third session, made an appropriation for\nthe organization of a mixed commission for adjudicating upon the claims of\ncitizens of the United States against Spain growing out of the insurrection\nin Cuba. That commission has since been organized. I transmit herewith the\ncorrespondence relating to its formation and its jurisdiction. It is to be\nhoped that this commission will afford the claimants a complete remedy for\ntheir injuries.It has been made the agreeable duty of the United States to preside over a\nconference at Washington between the plenipotentiaries of Spain and the\nallied South American Republics, which has resulted in an armistice, with\nthe reasonable assurance of a permanent peace.The intimate friendly relations which have so long existed between the\nUnited States and Russia continue undisturbed. The visit of the third son\nof the Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of his\nGovernment to diminish the cordiality of those relations. The hospitable\nreception which has been given to the Grand Duke is a proof that on our\nside we share the wishes of that Government. The inexcusable course of the\nRussian minister at Washington rendered it necessary to ask his recall and\nto decline to longer receive that functionary as a diplomatic\nrepresentative. It was impossible, with self-respect or with a just regard\nto the dignity of the country, to permit Mr. Catacazy to continue to hold\nintercourse with this Government after his personal abuse of Government\nofficials, and during his persistent interferences, through various means,\nwith the relations between the United States and other powers. In\naccordance with my wishes, this Government has been relieved of further\nintercourse with Mr. Catacazy, and the management of the affairs of the\nimperial legation has passed into the hands of a gentleman entirely\nunobjectionable.With Japan we continue to maintain intimate relations. The cabinet of the\nMikado has since the close of the last session of Congress selected\ncitizens of the United States to serve in offices of importance in several\ndepartments of Government. I have reason to think that this selection is\ndue to an appreciation of the disinterestedness of the policy which the\nUnited States have pursued toward Japan. It is our desire to continue to\nmaintain this disinterested and just policy with China as well as Japan.\nThe correspondence transmitted herewith shows that there is no disposition\non the part of this Government to swerve from its established course.Prompted by a desire to put an end to the barbarous treatment of our\nshipwrecked sailors on the Korean coast, I instructed our minister at\nPeking to endeavor to conclude a convention with Korea for securing the\nsafety and humane treatment of such mariners.Admiral Rodgers was instructed to accompany him with a sufficient force to\nprotect him in case of need.A small surveying party sent out, on reaching the coast was treacherously\nattacked at a disadvantage. Ample opportunity was given for explanation and\napology for the insult. Neither came. A force was then landed. After an\narduous march over a rugged and difficult country, the forts from which the\noutrages had been committed were reduced by a gallant assault and were\ndestroyed. Having thus punished the criminals, and having vindicated the\nhonor of the flag, the expedition returned, finding it impracticable under\nthe circumstances to conclude the desired convention. I respectfully refer\nto the correspondence relating thereto, herewith submitted, and leave the\nsubject for such action as Congress may see fit to take.The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the very objectionable laws\nestablishing what is known as the \"free zone\" on the frontier of the United\nStates. It is hoped that this may yet be done, and also that more stringent\nmeasures may be taken by that Republic for restraining lawless persons on\nits frontiers. I hope that Mexico by its own action will soon relieve this\nGovernment of the difficulties experienced from these causes.Our relations with the various Republics of Central and South America\ncontinue, with one exception, to be cordial and friendly.I recommend some action by Congress regarding the overdue installments\nunder the award of the Venezuelan Claims Commission of 1866. The internal\ndissensions of this Government present no justification for the absence of\neffort to meet their solemn treaty obligations.The ratification of an extradition treaty with Nicaragua has been\nexchanged.It is a subject for congratulation that the great Empire of Brazil has\ntaken the initiatory step toward the abolition of slavery. Our relations\nwith that Empire, always cordial, will naturally be made more so by this\nact. It is not too much to hope that the Government of Brazil may hereafter\nfind it for its interest, as well as intrinsically right, to advance toward\nentire emancipation more rapidly than the present act contemplates.The true prosperity and greatness of a nation is to be found in the\nelevation and education of its laborers.It is a subject for regret that the reforms in this direction which were\nvoluntarily promised by the statesmen of Spain have not been carried out in\nits West India colonies. The laws and regulations for the apparent\nabolition of slavery in Cuba and Porto Rico leave most of the laborers in\nbondage, with no hope of release until their lives become a burden to their\nemployers.I desire to direct your attention to the fact that citizens of the United\nStates, or persons claiming to be citizens of the United States, are large\nholders in foreign lands of this species of property, forbidden by the\nfundamental law of their alleged country. I recommend to Congress to\nprovide by stringent legislation a suitable remedy against the holding,\nowning or dealing in slaves, or being interested in slave property, in\nforeign lands, either as owners, hirers, or mortgagors, by citizens of the\nUnited States.It is to be regretted that the disturbed condition of the island of Cuba\ncontinues to be a source of annoyance and of anxiety. The existence of a\nprotracted struggle in such close proximity to our own territory, without\napparent prospect of an early termination, can not be other than an object\nof concern to a people who, while abstaining from interference in the\naffairs of other powers, naturally desire to see every country in the\nundisturbed enjoyment of peace, liberty, and the blessings of free\ninstitutions.Our naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed, in case it\nshould become necessary, to spare no effort to protect the lives and\nproperty of bona fide American citizens and to maintain the dignity of the\nflag.It is hoped that all pending questions with Spain growing out of the\naffairs in Cuba may be adjusted in the spirit of peace and conciliation\nwhich has hitherto guided the two powers in their treatment of such\nquestions.To give importance to and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic\nrelations with Japan and China, and to further aid in retaining the good\nopinion of those peoples, and to secure to the United States its share of\nthe commerce destined to flow between those nations and the balance of the\ncommercial world, I earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made to\nsupport at least four American youths in each of those countries, to serve\nas a part of the official family of our ministers there. Our\nrepresentatives would not even then be placed upon an equality with the\nrepresentatives of Great Britain and of some other powers. As now situated,\nour representatives in Japan and China have to depend for interpreters and\ntranslators upon natives of those countries who know our language\nimperfectly, or procure for the occasion the services of employees in\nforeign business houses or the interpreters to other foreign ministers.I would also recommend liberal measures for the purpose of supporting the\nAmerican lines of steamers now plying between San Francisco and Japan and\nChina, and the Australian line--almost our only remaining lines of ocean\nsteamers--and of increasing their services.The national debt has been reduced to the extent of $86,057, 126.80 during\nthe year, and by the negotiation of national bonds at a lower rate of\ninterest the interest on the public debt has been so far diminished that\nnow the sum to be raised for the interest account is nearly $17,000,000\nless than on the 1st of March, 1869. It was highly desirable that this\nrapid diminution should take place, both to strengthen the credit of the\ncountry and to convince its citizens of their entire ability to meet every\ndollar of liability without bankrupting them. But in view of the\naccomplishment of these desirable ends: of the rapid development of the\nresources of the country; its increasing ability to meet large demands, and\nthe amount already paid, it is not desirable that the present resources of\nthe country should continue to be taxed in order to continue this rapid\npayment. I therefore recommend a modification of both the tariff and\ninternal-tax law. I recommend that all taxes from internal sources be\nabolished, except those collected from spirituous, vinous, and malt\nliquors, tobacco in its various forms, and from stamps.In readjusting the tariff I suggest that a careful estimate be made of the\namount of surplus revenue collected under the present laws, after providing\nfor the current expenses of the Government, the interest count, and a\nsinking fund, and that this surplus be reduced in such a manner as to\nafford the greatest relief to the greatest number. There are many articles\nnot produced at home, but which enter largely into general consumption\nthrough articles which are manufactured at home, such as medicines\ncompounded, etc., etc., from which very little revenue is derived, but\nwhich enter into general use. All such articles I recommend to be placed on\nthe \"free list.\" Should a further reduction prove advisable, I would then\nrecommend that it be made upon those articles which can best bear it\nwithout disturbing home production or reducing the wages of American\nlabor.I have not entered into figures, because to do so would be to repeat what\nwill be laid before you in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The\npresent laws for collecting revenue pay collectors of customs small\nsalaries, but provide for moieties (shares in all seizures), which, at\nprincipal ports of entry particularly, raise the compensation of those\nofficials to a large sum. It has always seemed to me as if this system must\nat times work perniciously. It holds out an inducement to dishonest men,\nshould such get possession of those offices, to be lax in their scrutiny of\ngoods entered, to enable them finally to make large seizures. Your\nattention is respectfully invited to this subject.Continued fluctuations in the value of gold, as compared with the national\ncurrency, has a most damaging effect upon the increase and development of\nthe country, in keeping up prices of all articles necessary in everyday\nlife. It fosters a spirit of gambling, prejudicial alike to national morals\nand the national finances. If the question can be met as to how to get a\nfixed value to our currency, that value constantly and uniformly\napproaching par with specie, a very desirable object will be gained.For the operations of the Army in the past year, the expense of maintaining\nit, the estimate for the ensuing year, and for continuing seacoast and\nother improvements conducted under the supervision of the War Department, I\nrefer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of War.I call your attention to the provisions of the act of Congress approved\nMarch 3, 1869, which discontinues promotions in the staff corps of the Army\nuntil provided for by law. I recommend that the number of officers in each\ngrade in the staff corps be fixed, and that whenever the number in any one\ngrade falls below the number so fixed, that the vacancy may be filled by\npromotion from the grade below. I also recommend that when the office of\nchief of a corps becomes vacant the place may be filled by selection from\nthe corps in which the vacancy exists.The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows an improvement in the number\nand efficiency of the naval force, without material increase in the expense\nof supporting it. This is due to the policy which has been adopted, and is\nbeing extended as fast as our material will admit, of using smaller vessels\nas cruisers on the several stations. By this means we have been enabled to\noccupy at once a larger extent of cruising grounds, to visit more\nfrequently the ports where the presence of our flag is desirable, and\ngenerally to discharge more efficiently the appropriate duties of the Navy\nin time of peace, without exceeding the number of men or the expenditure\nauthorized by law.During the past year the Navy has, in addition to its regular service,\nsupplied the men and officers for the vessels of the Coast Survey, and has\ncompleted the surveys authorized by Congress of the isthmuses of Darien and\nTehuantepec, and, under like authority, has sent out an expedition,\ncompletely furnished and equipped, to explore the unknown ocean of the\nnorth.The suggestions of the report as to the necessity for increasing and\nimproving the materiel of the Navy, and the plan recommended for reducing\nthe personnel of the service to a peace standard, by the gradual abolition\nof certain grades of officers, the reduction of others, and the employment\nof some in the service of the commercial marine, are well considered and\ndeserve the thoughtful attention of Congress.I also recommend that all promotions in the Navy above the rank of captain\nbe by selection instead of by seniority. This course will secure in the\nhigher grades greater efficiency and hold out an incentive to young\nofficers to improve themselves in the knowledge of their profession.The present cost of maintaining the Navy, its cost compared with that of\nthe preceding year, and the estimates for the ensuing year are contained in\nthe accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy.The enlarged receipts of the Post-Office Department, as shown by the\naccompanying report of the Postmaster-General, exhibit a gratifying\nincrease in that branch of the public service. It is the index of the\ngrowth of education and of the prosperity of the people, two elements\nhighly conducive to the vigor and stability of republics. With a vast\nterritory like ours, much of it sparsely populated, but all requiring the\nservices of the mail, it is not at present to be expected that this\nDepartment can be made self-sustaining. But a gradual approach to this end\nfrom year to year is confidently relied on, and the day is not far distant\nwhen the Post-Office Department of the Government will prove a much greater\nblessing to the whole people than it is now.The suggestions of the Postmaster-General for improvements in the\nDepartment presided over by him are earnestly recommended to you, special\nattention. Especially do I recommend favorable consideration of the plan\nfor uniting the telegraphic system of the United States with the postal\nsystem. It is believed that by such a course the cost of telegraphing could\nbe much reduced, and the service as well, if not better, rendered. It would\nsecure the further advantage of extending the telegraph through portions of\nthe country where private enterprise will not construct it. Commerce,\ntrade, and, above all, the efforts to bring a people widely separated into\na community of interest are always benefited by a rapid intercommunication.\nEducation, the groundwork of republican institutions, is encouraged by\nincreasing the facilities to gather speedy news from all parts of the\ncountry. The desire to reap the benefit of such improvements will stimulate\neducation. I refer you to the report of the Postmaster-General for full\ndetails of the operations of last year and for comparative statements of\nresults with former years.There has been imposed upon the executive branch of the Government the\nexecution of the act of Congress approved April 20, 1871, and commonly\nknown as the Kuklux law, in a portion of the State of South Carolina. The\nnecessity of the course pursued will be demonstrated by the report of the\nCommittee to Investigate Southern Outrages. Under the provisions of the\nabove act I issued a proclamation calling the attention of the people of\nthe United States to the same, and declaring my reluctance to exercise any\nof the extraordinary powers thereby conferred upon me, except in case of\nimperative necessity, but making known my purpose to exercise such powers\nwhenever it should become necessary to do so for the purpose of securing to\nall citizens of the United States the peaceful enjoyment of the rights\nguaranteed to them by the Constitution and the laws.After the passage of this law information was received from time to time\nthat combinations of the character referred to in this law existed and were\npowerful in many parts of the Southern States, particularly in certain\ncounties in the State of South Carolina.Careful investigation was made, and it was ascertained that in nine\ncounties of that State such combinations were active and powerful,\nembracing a sufficient portion of the citizens to control the local\nauthority, and having, among other things, the object of depriving the\nemancipated class of the substantial benefits of freedom and of preventing\nthe free political action of those citizens who did not sympathize with\ntheir own views. Among their operations were frequent scourgings and\noccasional assassinations, generally perpetrated at night by disguised\npersons, the victims in almost all cases being citizens of different\npolitical sentiments from their own or freed persons who had shown a\ndisposition to claim equal rights with other citizens. Thousands of\ninoffensive and well disposed citizens were the sufferers by this lawless\nviolence,Thereupon, on the 12th of October, 1871, a proclamation was issued, in\nterms of the law, calling upon the members of those combinations to\ndisperse within five days and to deliver to the marshal or military\nofficers of the United States all arms, ammunition, uniforms, disguises,\nand other means and implements used by them for carrying out their unlawful\npurposes.This warning not having been heeded, on the 17th of October another\nproclamation was issued, suspending the privileges of the writ of habeas\ncorpus in nine counties in that State.Direction was given that within the counties so designated persons\nsupposed, upon creditable information, to be members of such unlawful\ncombinations should be arrested by the military forces of the United States\nand delivered to the marshal, to be dealt with according to law. In two of\nsaid counties, York and Spartanburg, many arrests have been made. At the\nlast account the number of persons thus arrested was 168. Several hundred,\nwhose criminality was ascertained to be of an inferior degree, were\nreleased for the present. These have generally made confessions of their\nguilt.Great caution has been exercised in making these arrests, and,\nnotwithstanding the large number, it is believed that no innocent person is\nnow in custody. The prisoners will be held for regular trial in the\njudicial tribunals of the United States.As soon as it appeared that the authorities of the United States were about\nto take vigorous measures to enforce the law, many persons absconded, and\nthere is good ground for supposing that all of such persons have violated\nthe law. A full report of what has been done under this law will be\nsubmitted to Congress by the Attorney-General.In Utah there still remains a remnant of barbarism, repugnant to\ncivilization, to decency, and to the laws of the United States. Territorial\nofficers, however, have been found who are willing to perform their duty in\na spirit of equity and with a due sense of the necessity of sustaining the\nmajesty of the law. Neither polygamy nor any other violation of existing\nstatutes will be permitted within the territory of the United States. It is\nnot with the religion of the self-styled Saints that we are now dealing,\nbut with their practices. They will be protected in the worship of God\naccording to the dictates of their consciences, but they will not be\npermitted to violate the laws under the cloak of religion.It may be advisable for Congress to consider what, in the execution of the\nlaws against polygamy, is to be the status of plural wives and their\noffspring. The propriety of Congress passing an enabling act authorizing\nthe Territorial legislature of Utah to legitimize all children born prior\nto a time fixed in the act might be justified by its humanity to these\ninnocent children. This is a suggestion only, and not a recommendation.The policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably, so far as can\nbe judged from the limited time during which it has been in operation.\nThrough the exertions of the various societies of Christians to whom has\nbeen intrusted the execution of the policy, and the board of commissioners\nauthorized by the law of April 10, 1869, many tribes of Indians have been\ninduced to settle upon reservations, to cultivate the soil, to perform\nproductive labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civilization.\nThey are being cared for in such a way, it is hoped, as to induce those\nstill pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity\nwhich is left them to avoid extermination.I recommend liberal appropriations to carry out the Indian peace policy,\nnot only because it is humane, Christian like, and economical, but because\nit is right.I recommend to your favorable consideration also the policy of granting a\nTerritorial government to the Indians in the Indian Territory west of\nArkansas and Missouri and south of Kansas. In doing so every right\nguaranteed to the Indian by treaty should be secured. Such a course might\nin time be the means of collecting most of the Indians now between the\nMissouri and the Pacific and south of the British possessions into one\nTerritory or one State. The Secretary of the Interior has treated upon this\nsubject at length, and I commend to you his suggestions.I renew my recommendation that the public lands be regarded as a heritage\nto our children, to be disposed of only as required for occupation and to\nactual settlers. Those already granted have been in great part disposed of\nin such a way as to secure access to the balance by the hardy settler who\nmay wish to avail himself of them, but caution should be exercised even in\nattaining so desirable an object.Educational interest may well be served by the grant of the proceeds of the\nsale of public lands to settlers. I do not wish to be understood as\nrecommending in the least degree a curtailment of what is being done by the\nGeneral Government for the encouragement of education.The report of the Secretary of the Interior submitted with this will give\nyou all the information collected and prepared for publication in regard to\nthe census taken during the year 1870; the operations of the Bureau of\nEducation for the year; the Patent Office; the Pension Office; the Land\nOffice, and the Indian Bureau.The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture gives the operations of his\nDepartment for the year. As agriculture is the groundwork of our\nprosperity, too much importance can not be attached to the labors of this\nDepartment. It is in the hands of an able head, with able assistants, all\nzealously devoted to introducing into the agricultural productions of the\nnation all useful products adapted to any of the various climates and soils\nof our vast territory, and to giving all useful information as to the\nmethod of cultivation, the plants, cereals, and other products adapted to\nparticular localities. Quietly but surely the Agricultural Bureau is\nworking a great national good, and if liberally supported the more widely\nits influence will be extended and the less dependent we shall be upon the\nproducts of foreign countries.The subject of compensation to the heads of bureaus and officials holding\npositions of responsibility, and requiring ability and character to fill\nproperly, is one to which your attention is invited. But few of the\nofficials receive a compensation equal to the respectable support of a\nfamily, while their duties are such as to involve millions of interest. In\nprivate life services demand compensation equal to the services rendered; a\nwise economy would dictate the same rule in the Government service.I have not given the estimates for the support of Government for the\nensuing year, nor the comparative statement between the expenditures for\nthe year just passed and the one just preceding, because all these figures\nare contained in the accompanying reports or in those presented directly to\nCongress. These estimates have my approval.More than six years having elapsed since the last hostile gun was fired\nbetween the armies then arrayed against each other--one for the\nperpetuation, the other for the destruction, of the Union--it may well be\nconsidered whether it is not now time that the disabilities imposed by the\nfourteenth amendment should be removed. That amendment does not exclude the\nballot, but only imposes the disability to hold offices upon certain\nclasses. When the purity of the ballot is secure, majorities are sure to\nelect officers reflecting the views of the majority. I do not see the\nadvantage or propriety of excluding men from office merely because they\nwere before the rebellion of standing and character sufficient to be\nelected to positions requiring them to take oaths to support the\nConstitution, and admitting to eligibility those entertaining precisely the\nsame views, but of less standing in their communities. It may be said that\nthe former violated an oath, while the latter did not; the latter did not\nhave it in their power to do so. If they had taken this oath, it can not be\ndoubted they would have broken it as did the former class. If there are any\ngreat criminals, distinguished above all others for the part they took in\nopposition to the Government, they might, in the judgment of Congress, be\nexcluded from such an amnesty.This subject is submitted for your careful consideration.The condition of the Southern States is, unhappily, not such as all true\npatriotic citizens would like to see. Social ostracism for opinion's sake,\npersonal violence or threats toward persons entertaining political views\nopposed to those entertained by the majority of the old citizens, prevents\nimmigration and the flow of much-needed capital into the States lately in\nrebellion. It will be a happy condition of the country when the old\ncitizens of these States will take an interest in public affairs,\npromulgate ideas honestly entertained, vote for men representing their\nviews, and tolerate the same freedom of expression and ballot in those\nentertaining different political convictions.Under the provisions of the act of Congress approved February 21, 1871, a\nTerritorial government was organized in the District of Columbia. Its\nresults have thus far fully realized the expectations of its advocates.\nUnder the direction of the Territorial officers, a system of improvements\nhas been inaugurated by means of which Washington is rapidly becoming a\ncity worthy of the nation's capital. The citizens of the District having\nvoluntarily taxed themselves to a large amount for the purpose of\ncontributing to the adornment of the seat of Government, I recommend\nliberal appropriations on the part of Congress, in order that the\nGovernment may bear its just share of the expense of carrying out a\njudicious system of improvements.By the great fire in Chicago the most important of the Government buildings\nin that city were consumed. Those burned had already become inadequate to\nthe wants of the Government in that growing city, and, looking to the near\nfuture, were totally inadequate. I recommend, therefore, that an\nappropriation be made immediately to purchase the remainder of the square\non which the burned buildings stood, provided it can be purchased at a fair\nvaluation, or provided that the legislature of Illinois will pass a law\nauthorizing its condemnation for Government purposes; and also an\nappropriation of as much money as can properly be expended toward the\nerection of new buildings during this fiscal year.The number of immigrants ignorant of our laws, habits, etc., coming into\nour country annually has become so great and the impositions practiced upon\nthem so numerous and flagrant that I suggest Congressional action for their\nprotection. It seems to me a fair subject of legislation by Congress. I can\nnot now state as fully as I desire the nature of the complaints made by\nimmigrants of the treatment they receive, but will endeavor to do so during\nthe session of Congress, particularly if the subject should receive your\nattention.It has been the aim of the Administration to enforce honesty and efficiency\nin all public offices. Every public servant who has violated the trust\nplaced in him has been proceeded against with all the rigor of the law. If\nbad men have secured places, it has been the fault of the system\nestablished by law and custom for making appointments, or the fault of\nthose who recommend for Government positions persons not sufficiently well\nknown to them personally, or who give letters indorsing the characters of\noffice seekers without a proper sense of the grave responsibility which\nsuch a course devolves upon them. A civil-service reform which can correct\nthis abuse is much desired. In mercantile pursuits the business man who\ngives a letter of recommendation to a friend to enable him to obtain credit\nfrom a stranger is regarded as morally responsible for the integrity of his\nfriend and his ability to meet his obligations. A reformatory law which\nwould enforce this principle against all indorsers of persons for public\nplace would insure great caution in making recommendations. A salutary\nlesson has been taught the careless and the dishonest public servant in the\ngreat number of prosecutions and convictions of the last two years.It is gratifying to notice the favorable change which is taking place\nthroughout the country in bringing to punishment those who have proven\nrecreant to the trusts confided to them and in elevating to public office\nnone but those who possess the confidence of the honest and the virtuous,\nwho, it will always be found, comprise the majority of the community in\nwhich they live.In my message to Congress one year ago I urgently recommended a reform in\nthe civil service of the country. In conformity with that recommendation\nCongress, in the ninth section of \"An act making appropriations for sundry\ncivil expenses of the Government, and for other purposes,\" approved March\n3, 1871, gave the necessary authority to the Executive to inaugurate a\ncivil-service reform, and placed upon him the responsibility of doing so.\nUnder the authority of said act I convened a board of gentlemen eminently\nqualified for the work to devise rules and regulations to effect the needed\nreform. Their labors are not yet complete, but it is believed that they\nwill succeed in devising a plan that can be adopted to the great relief of\nthe Executive, the heads of Departments, and members of Congress, and which\nwill redound to the true interest of the public service. At all events, the\nexperiment shall have a fair trial.I have thus hastily summed up the operations of the Government during the\nlast year, and made such suggestions as occur to me to be proper for your\nconsideration. I submit them with a confidence that your combined action\nwill be wise, statesmanlike, and in the best interests of the whole\ncountry.U. S. GRANT",
