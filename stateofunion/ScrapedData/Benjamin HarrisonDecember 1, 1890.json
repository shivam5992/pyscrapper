    "speech": "To the Senate and House of Representatives:The reports of the several Executive Departments, which will be laid before\nCongress in the usual course, will exhibit in detail the operations of the\nGovernment for the last fiscal year. Only the more important incidents and\nresults, and chiefly such as may be the foundation of the recommendations I\nshall submit, will be referred to in this annual message.The vast and increasing business of the Government has been transacted by\nthe several Departments during the year with faithfulness, energy, and\nsuccess.The revenues, amounting to above $450,000,000, have been collected and\ndisbursed without revealing, so far as I can ascertain, a single case of\ndefalcation or embezzlement. An earnest effort has been made to stimulate a\nsense of responsibility and public duty in all officers and employees of\nevery grade, and the work done by them has almost wholly escaped\nunfavorable criticism. I speak of these matters with freedom because the\ncredit of this good work is not mine, but is shared by the heads of the\nseveral Departments with the great body of faithful officers and employees\nwho serve under them. The closest scrutiny of Congress is invited to all\nthe methods of administration and to every item of expenditure.The friendly relations of our country with the nations of Europe and of the\nEast have been undisturbed, while the ties of good will and common interest\nthat bind us to the States of the Western Hemisphere have been notably\nstrengthened by the conference held in this capital to consider measures\nfor the general welfare. Pursuant to the invitation authorized by Congress,\nthe representatives of every independent State of the American continent\nand of Hayti met in conference in this capital in October, 1889, and\ncontinued in session until the 19th of last April. This important\nconvocation marks a most interesting and influential epoch in the history\nof the Western Hemisphere. It is noteworthy that Brazil, invited while\nunder an imperial form of government, shared as a republic in the\ndeliberations and results of the conference. The recommendations of this\nconference were all transmitted to Congress at the last session.The International Marine Conference, which sat at Washington last winter,\nreached a very gratifying result. The regulations suggested have been\nbrought to the attention of all the Governments represented, and their\ngeneral adoption is confidently expected. The legislation of Congress at\nthe last session is in conformity with the propositions of the conference,\nand the proclamation therein provided for will be issued when the other\npowers have given notice of their adhesion.The Conference of Brussels, to devise means for suppressing the slave trade\nin Africa, afforded an opportunity for a new expression of the interest the\nAmerican people feel in that great work. It soon became evident that the\nmeasure proposed would tax the resources of the Kongo Basin beyond the\nrevenues available under the general act of Berlin of 1884. The United\nStates, not being a party to that act, could not share in its revision, but\nby a separate act the Independent State of the Kongo was freed from the\nrestrictions upon a customs revenue. The demoralizing and destructive\ntraffic in ardent spirits among the tribes also claimed the earnest\nattention of the conference, and the delegates of the United States were\nforemost in advocating measures for its repression. An accord was reached\nthe influence of which will be very helpful and extend over a wide region.\nAs soon as these measures shall receive the sanction of the Netherlands,\nfor a time withheld, the general acts will be submitted for ratification by\nthe Senate. Meanwhile negotiations have been opened for a new and completed\ntreaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation between the United States\nand the Independent State of the Kongo.Toward the end of the past year the only independent monarchical government\non the Western Continent, that of Brazil, ceased to exist, and was\nsucceeded by a republic. Diplomatic relations were at once established with\nthe new Government, but it was not completely recognized until an\nopportunity had been afforded to ascertain that it had popular approval and\nsupport. When the course of events had yielded assurance of this fact, no\ntime was lost in extending to the new Government a full and cordial welcome\ninto the family of American Commonwealths. It is confidently believed that\nthe good relations of the two countries will be preserved and that the\nfuture will witness an increased intimacy of intercourse and an expansion\nof their mutual commerce.The peace of Central America has again been disturbed through a\nrevolutionary change in Salvador, which was not recognized by other States,\nand hostilities broke out between Salvador and Guatemala, threatening to\ninvolve all Central America in conflict and to undo the progress which had\nbeen made toward a union of their interests. The efforts of this Government\nwere promptly and zealously exerted to compose their differences, and\nthrough the active efforts of the representative of the United States a\nprovisional treaty of peace was signed August 26, whereby the right of the\nRepublic of Salvador to choose its own rulers was recognized. General\nEzeta, the chief of the Provisional Government, has since been confirmed in\nthe Presidency by the Assembly, and diplomatic recognition duly followed.The killing of General Barrundia on board the Pacific mail steamer\nAcapulco, while anchored in transit in the port of San Jose de Guatemala,\ndemanded careful inquiry. Having failed in a revolutionary attempt to\ninvade Guatemala from Mexican territory, General Barrundia took passage at\nAcapulco for Panama. The consent of the representatives of the United\nStates was sought to effect his seizure, first at Champerico, where the\nsteamer touched, and afterwards at San Jose. The captain of the steamer\nrefused to give up his passenger without a written order from the United\nStates minister. The latter furnished the desired letter, stipulating as\nthe condition of his action that General Barrundia's life should be spared\nand that he should be tried only for offenses growing out of his\ninsurrectionary movements. This letter was produced to the captain of the\nAcapulco by the military commander at San Jose as his warrant to take the\npassenger from the steamer. General Barrundia resisted capture and was\nkilled. It being evident that the minister, Mr. Mizner, had exceeded the\nbounds of his authority in intervening, in compliance with the demands of\nthe Guatemalan authorities, to authorize and effect, in violation of\nprecedent, the seizure on a vessel of the United States of a passenger in\ntransit charged with political offenses, in order that he might be tried\nfor such offenses under what was described as martial law, I was\nconstrained to disavow Mr. Mizner's act and recall him from his post.The Nicaragua Canal project, under the control of our citizens, is making\nmost encouraging progress, all the preliminary conditions and initial\noperations having been accomplished within the prescribed time.During the past year negotiations have been renewed for the settlement of\nthe claims of American citizens against the Government of Chile,\nprincipally growing out of the late war with Peru. The reports from our\nminister at Santiago warrant the expectation of an early and satisfactory\nadjustment.Our relations with China, which have for several years occupied so\nimportant a place in our diplomatic history, have called for careful\nconsideration and have been the subject of much correspondence.The communications of the Chinese minister have brought into view the whole\nsubject of our conventional relations with his country, and at the same\ntime this Government, through its legation at Peking, has sought to arrange\nvarious matters and complaints touching the interests and protection of our\ncitizens in China.In pursuance of the concurrent resolution of October 1, 1890, I have\nproposed to the Governments of Mexico and Great Britain to consider a\nconventional regulation of the passage of Chinese laborers across our\nsouthern and northern frontiers.On the 22d day of August last Sir Edmund Monson, the arbitrator selected\nunder the treaty of December 6, 1888, rendered an award to the effect that\nno compensation was due from the Danish Government to the United States on\naccount of what is commonly known as the Carlos Butterfield claim.Our relations with the French Republic continue to be cordial. Our\nrepresentative at that court has very diligently urged the removal of the\nrestrictions imposed upon our meat products, and it is believed that\nsubstantial progress has been made toward a just settlement.The Samoan treaty, signed last year at Berlin by the representatives of the\nUnited States, Germany, and Great Britain, after due ratification and\nexchange, has begun to produce salutary effects. The formation of the\ngovernment agreed upon will soon replace the disorder of the past by a\nstable administration alike just to the natives and equitable to the three\npowers most concerned in trade and intercourse with the Samoan Islands. The\nchief justice has been chosen by the King of Sweden and Norway on the\ninvitation of the three powers, and will soon be installed. The land\ncommission and the municipal council are in process of organization. A\nrational and evenly distributed scheme of taxation, both municipal and upon\nimports, is in operation. Malietoa is respected as King.The new treaty of extradition with Great Britain, after due ratification,\nwas proclaimed on the 25th of last March. Its beneficial working is already\napparent.The difference between the two Governments touching the fur-seal question\nin the Bering Sea is not yet adjusted, as will be seen by the\ncorrespondence which will soon be laid before the Congress. The offer to\nsubmit the question to arbitration, as proposed by Her Majesty's\nGovernment, has not been accepted, for the reason that the form of\nsubmission proposed is not thought to be calculated to assure a conclusion\nsatisfactory to either party. It is sincerely hoped that before the opening\nof another sealing season some arrangement may be effected which will\nassure to the United States a property right derived from Russia, which was\nnot disregarded by any nation for more than eighty years preceding the\noutbreak of the existing trouble.In the tariff act a wrong was done to the Kingdom of Hawaii which I am\nbound to presume was wholly unintentional. Duties were levied on certain\ncommodities which are included in the reciprocity treaty now existing\nbetween the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii, without indicating the\nnecessary exception in favor of that Kingdom. I hope Congress will repair\nwhat might otherwise seem to be a breach of faith on the part of this\nGovernment.An award in favor of the United States in the matter of the claim of Mr.\nVan Bokkelen against Hayti was rendered on the 4th of December, 1888, but\nowing to disorders then and afterwards prevailing in Hayti the terms of\npayment were not observed. A new agreement as to the time of payment has\nbeen approved and is now in force. Other just claims of citizens of the\nUnited States for redress of wrongs suffered during the late political\nconflict in Hayti will, it is hoped, speedily yield to friendly treatment.Propositions for the amendment of the treaty of extradition between the\nUnited States and Italy are now under consideration.You will be asked to provide the means of accepting the invitation of the\nItalian Government to take part in an approaching conference to consider\nthe adoption of a universal prime meridian from which to reckon longitude\nand time. As this proposal follows in the track of the reform sought to be\ninitiated by the Meridian Conference of Washington, held on the invitation\nof this Government, the United States should manifest a friendly interest\nin the Italian proposal.In this connection I may refer with approval to the suggestion of my\npredecessors that standing provision be made for accepting, whenever deemed\nadvisable, the frequent invitations of foreign governments to share in\nconferences looking to the advancement of international reforms in regard\nto science, sanitation, commercial laws and procedure, and other matters\naffecting the intercourse and progress of modern communities.In the summer of 1889 an incident occurred which for some time threatened\nto interrupt the cordiality of our relations with the Government of\nPortugal. That Government seized the Delagoa Bay Railway, which was\nconstructed under a concession granted to an American citizen, and at the\nsame time annulled the charter. The concessionary, who had embarked his\nfortune in the enterprise, having exhausted other means of redress, was\ncompelled to invoke the protection of his Government. Our representations,\nmade coincidently with those of the British Government, whose subjects were\nalso largely interested, happily resulted in the recognition by Portugal of\nthe propriety of submitting the claim for indemnity growing out of its\naction to arbitration. This plan of settlement having been agreed upon, the\ninterested powers readily concurred in the proposal to submit the case to\nthe judgment of three eminent jurists, to be designated by the President of\nthe Swiss Republic, who, upon the joint invitation of the Governments of\nthe United States, Great Britain, and Portugal, has selected persons well\nqualified for the task before them.The revision of our treaty relations with the Empire of Japan has continued\nto be the subject of consideration and of correspondence. The questions\ninvolved are both grave and delicate; and while it will be my duty to see\nthat the interests of the United States are not by any changes exposed to\nundue discrimination, I sincerely hope that such revision as will satisfy\nthe legitimate expectations of the Japanese Government and maintain the\npresent and long-existing friendly relations between Japan and the United\nStates will be effected.The friendship between our country and Mexico, born of close neighborhood\nand strengthened by many considerations of intimate intercourse and\nreciprocal interest, has never been more conspicuous than now nor more\nhopeful of increased benefit to both nations. The intercourse of the two\ncountries by rail, already great, is making constant growth. The\nestablished lines and those recently projected add to the intimacy of\ntraffic and open new channels of access to fresh areas of demand and\nsupply. The importance of the Mexican railway system will be further\nenhanced to a degree almost impossible to forecast if it should become a\nlink in the projected intercontinental railway. I recommend that our\nmission in the City of Mexico be raised to the first class.The cordial character of our relations with Spain warrants the hope that by\nthe continuance of methods of friendly negotiation much may be accomplished\nin the direction of an adjustment of pending questions and of the increase\nof our trade. The extent and development of our trade with the island of\nCuba invest the commercial relations of the United States and Spain with a\npeculiar importance. It is not doubted that a special arrangement in regard\nto commerce, based upon the reciprocity provision of the recent tariff act,\nwould operate most beneficially for both Governments. This subject is now\nreceiving attention.The restoration of the remains of John Ericsson to Sweden afforded a\ngratifying occasion to honor the memory of the great inventor, to whose\ngenius our country owes so much, and to bear witness to the unbroken\nfriendship which has existed between the land which bore him and our own,\nwhich claimed him as a citizen.On the 2d of September last the commission appointed to revise the\nproceedings of the commission under the claims convention between the\nUnited States and Venezuela of 1866 brought its labors to a close within\nthe period fixed for that purpose. The proceedings of the late commission\nwere characterized by a spirit of impartiality and a high sense of justice,\nand an incident which was for many years the subject of discussion between\nthe two Governments has been disposed of in a manner alike honorable and\nsatisfactory to both parties. For the settlement of the claim of the\nVenezuela Steam Transportation Company, which was the subject of a joint\nresolution adopted at the last session of Congress, negotiations are still\nin progress, and their early conclusion is anticipated.The legislation of the past few years has evinced on the part of Congress a\ngrowing realization of the importance of the consular service in fostering\nour commercial relations abroad and in protecting the domestic revenues. As\nthe scope of operations expands increased provision must be made to keep up\nthe essential standard of efficiency. The necessity of some adequate\nmeasure of supervision and inspection has been so often presented that I\nneed only commend the subject to your attention.The revenues of the Government from all sources for the fiscal year ending\nJune 30, 1890, were $463,963,080.55 and the total expenditures for the same\nperiod were $358,618,584.52. The postal receipts have not heretofore been\nincluded in the statement of these aggregates, and for the purpose of\ncomparison the sum of $60,882,097.92 should be deducted from both sides of\nthe account. The surplus for the year, including the amount applied to the\nsinking fund, was $105,344,496.03. The receipts for 1890 were\n$16,030,923.79 and the expenditures $15,739,871 in excess of those of 1889.\nThe customs receipts increased $5,835,842.88 and the receipts from internal\nrevenue $11,725,191.89, while on the side of expenditures that for pensions\nwas $19,312,075.96 in excess of the preceding year.The Treasury statement for the current fiscal year, partly actual and\npartly estimated, is as follows: Receipts from all sources, $406,000,000;\ntotal expenditures, $354,000,000, leaving a surplus of $52,000,000, not\ntaking the postal receipts into the account on either side. The loss of\nrevenue from customs for the last quarter is estimated at $25,000,000, but\nfrom this is deducted a gain of about $16,000,000 realized during the first\nfour months of the year.For the year 1892 the total estimated receipts are $373,000,000 and the\nestimated expenditures $357,852,209.42, leaving an estimated surplus of\n$15,247,790.58, which, with a cash balance of $52,000,000 at the beginning\nof the year, will give $67,247,790.58 as the sum available for the\nredemption of outstanding bonds or other uses. The estimates of receipts\nand expenditures for the Post-Office Department, being equal, are not\nincluded in this statement on either side.The act \"directing the purchase of silver bullion and the issue of Treasury\nnotes thereon,\" approved July 14, 1890, has been administered by the\nSecretary of the Treasury with an earnest purpose to get into circulation\nat the earliest possible dates the full monthly amounts of Treasury notes\ncontemplated by its provisions and at the same time to give to the market\nfor the silver bullion such support as the law contemplates. The recent\ndepreciation in the price of silver has been observed with regret. The\nrapid rise in price which anticipated and followed the passage of the act\nwas influenced in some degree by speculation, and the recent reaction is in\npart the result of the same cause and in part of the recent monetary\ndisturbances. Some months of further trial will be necessary to determine\nthe permanent effect of the recent legislation upon silver values, but it\nis gratifying to know that the increased circulation secured by the act has\nexerted, and will continue to exert, a most beneficial influence upon\nbusiness and upon general values.While it has not been thought best to renew formally the suggestion of an\ninternational conference looking to an agreement touching the full use of\nsilver for coinage at a uniform ratio, care has been taken to observe\nclosely any change in the situation abroad, and no favorable opportunity\nwill be lost to promote a result which it is confidently believed would\nconfer very large benefits upon the commerce of the world.The recent monetary disturbances in England are not unlikely to suggest a\nreexamination of opinions upon this subject. Our very large supply of gold\nwill, if not lost by impulsive legislation in the supposed interest of\nsilver, give us a position of advantage in promoting a permanent and safe\ninternational agreement for the free use of silver as a coin metal.The efforts of the Secretary to increase the volume of money in circulation\nby keeping down the Treasury surplus to the lowest practicable limit have\nbeen unremitting and in a very high degree successful. The tables presented\nby him showing the increase of money in circulation during the last two\ndecades, and especially the table showing the increase during the nineteen\nmonths he has administered the affairs of the Department, are interesting\nand instructive. The increase of money in circulation during the nineteen\nmonths has been in the aggregate $93,866,813, or about $1.50 per capita,\nand of this increase only $7,100,000 was due to the recent silver\nlegislation. That this substantial and needed aid given to commerce\nresulted in an enormous reduction of the public debt and of the annual\ninterest charge is matter of increased satisfaction. There have been\npurchased and redeemed since March 4, 1889, 4 and 4 1\\2 per cent bonds to\nthe amount of $211,832,450, at a cost of $246,620,741, resulting in the\nreduction of the annual interest charge of $8,967,609 and a total saving of\ninterest of $51,576,706.I notice with great pleasure the statement of the Secretary that the\nreceipts from internal revenue have increased during the last fiscal year\nnearly $12,000,000, and that the cost of collecting this larger revenue was\nless by $90,617 than for the same purpose in the preceding year. The\npercentage of cost of collecting the customs revenue was less for the last\nfiscal year than ever before.The Customs Administration Board, provided for by the act of June 10, 1890,\nwas selected with great care, and is composed in part of men whose previous\nexperience in the administration of the old customs regulations had made\nthem familiar with the evils to be remedied, and in part of men whose legal\nand judicial acquirements and experience seemed to fit them for the work of\ninterpreting and applying the new statute. The chief aim of the law is to\nsecure honest valuations of all dutiable merchandise and to make these\nvaluations uniform at all our ports of entry. It had been made manifest by\na Congressional investigation that a system of undervaluation had been long\nin use by certain classes of importers, resulting not only in a great loss\nof revenue, but in a most intolerable discrimination against honesty. It is\nnot seen how this legislation, when it is understood, can be regarded by\nthe citizens of any country having commercial dealings with us as\nunfriendly. If any duty is supposed to be excessive, let the complaint be\nlodged there. It will surely not be claimed by any well-disposed people\nthat a remedy may be sought and allowed in a system of quasi smuggling.The report of the Secretary of War exhibits several gratifying results\nattained during the year by wise and unostentatious methods. The percentage\nof desertions from the Army (an evil for which both Congress and the\nDepartment have long been seeking a remedy) has been reduced during the\npast year 24 per cent, and for the months of August and September, during\nwhich time the favorable effects of the act of June 16 were felt, 33 per\ncent, as compared with the same months of 1889.The results attained by a reorganization and consolidation of the divisions\nhaving charge of the hospital and service records of the volunteer soldiers\nare very remarkable. This change was effected in July, 1889, and at that\ntime there were 40,654 cases awaiting attention, more than half of these\nbeing calls from the Pension Office for information necessary to the\nadjudication of pension claims. On the 30th day of June last, though over\n300,000 new calls had come in, there was not a single case that had not\nbeen examined and answered.I concur in the recommendations of the Secretary that adequate and regular\nappropriations be continued for coast-defense works and ordnance. Plans\nhave been practically agreed upon, and there can be no good reason for\ndelaying the execution of them, while the defenseless state of our great\nseaports furnishes an urgent reason for wise expedition.The encouragement that has been extended to the militia of the States,\ngenerally and most appropriately designated the \"National Guard,\" should be\ncontinued and enlarged. These military organizations constitute in a large\nsense the Army of the United States, while about five-sixths of the annual\ncost of their maintenance is defrayed by the States.The report of the Attorney-General is under the law submitted directly to\nCongress, but as the Department of Justice is one of the Executive\nDepartments some reference to the work done is appropriate here.A vigorous and in the main an effective effort has been made to bring to\ntrial and punishment all violators of the law, but at the same time care\nhas been taken that frivolous and technical offenses should not be used to\nswell the fees of officers or to harass well-disposed citizens. Especial\nattention is called to the facts connected with the prosecution of\nviolations of the election laws and of offenses against United States\nofficers. The number of convictions secured, very many of them upon pleas\nof guilty, will, it is hoped, have a salutary restraining influence. There\nhave been several cases where postmasters appointed by me have been\nsubjected to violent interference in the discharge of their official duties\nand to persecutions and personal violence of the most extreme character.\nSome of these cases have been dealt with through the Department of Justice,\nand in some cases the post-offices have been abolished or suspended. I have\ndirected the Postmaster-General to pursue this course in all cases where\nother efforts failed to secure for any postmaster not himself in fault an\nopportunity peacefully to exercise the duties of his office. But such\naction will not supplant the efforts of the Department of Justice to bring\nthe particular offenders to punishment.The vacation by judicial decrees of fraudulent certificates of\nnaturalization, upon bills in equity filed by the Attorney-General in the\ncircuit court of the United States, is a new application of a familiar\nequity jurisdiction. Nearly one hundred such decrees have been taken during\nthe year, the evidence disclosing that a very large number of fraudulent\ncertificates of naturalization have been issued. And in this connection I\nbeg to renew my recommendation that the laws be so amended as to require a\nmore full and searching inquiry into all the facts necessary to\nnaturalization before any certificates are granted. It certainly is not too\nmuch to require that an application for American citizenship shall be heard\nwith as much care and recorded with as much formality as are given to cases\ninvolving the pettiest property right.At the last session I returned without my approval a bill entitled \"An act\nto prohibit bookmaking and pool selling in the District of Columbia,\" and\nstated my objection to be that it did not prohibit but in fact licensed\nwhat it purported to prohibit. An effort will be made under existing laws\nto suppress this evil, though it is not certain that they will be found\nadequate.The report of the Postmaster-General shows the most gratifying progress in\nthe important work committed to his direction. The business methods have\nbeen greatly improved. A large economy in expenditures and an increase of\nfour and three-quarters millions in receipts have been realized. The\ndeficiency this year is $5,786,300, as against $6,350,183 last year,\nnotwithstanding the great enlargement of the service. Mail routes have been\nextended and quickened and greater accuracy and dispatch in distribution\nand delivery have been attained. The report will be found to be full of\ninterest and suggestion, not only to Congress, but to those thoughtful\ncitizens who may be interested to know what business methods can do for\nthat department of public administration which most nearly touches all our\npeople.The passage of the act to amend certain sections of the Revised Statutes\nrelating to lotteries, approved September 19, 1890, has been received with\ngreat and deserved popular favor. The Post-Office Department and the\nDepartment of Justice at once entered upon the enforcement of the law with\nsympathetic vigor, and already the public mails have been largely freed\nfrom the fraudulent and demoralizing appeals and literature emanating from\nthe lottery companies.The construction and equipment of the new ships for the Navy have made very\nsatisfactory progress. Since March 4, 1889, nine new vessels have been put\nin commission, and during this winter four more, including one monitor,\nwill be added. The construction of the other vessels authorized is being\npushed both in the Government and private yards with energy and watched\nwith the most scrupulous care.The experiments conducted during the year to test the relative resisting\npower of armor plates have been so valuable as to attract great attention\nin Europe. The only part of the work upon the new ships that is threatened\nby unusual delay is the armor plating, and every effort is being made to\nreduce that to the minimum. It is a source of congratulation that the\nanticipated influence of these modern vessels upon the esprit de corps of\nthe officers and seamen has been fully realized. Confidence and pride in\nthe ship among the crew are equivalent to a secondary battery. Your\nfavorable consideration is invited to the recommendations of the\nSecretary.The report of the Secretary of the Interior exhibits with great fullness\nand clearness the vast work of that Department and the satisfactory results\nattained. The suggestions made by him are earnestly commended to the\nconsideration of Congress, though they can not all be given particular\nmention here.The several acts of Congress looking to the reduction of the larger Indian\nreservations, to the more rapid settlement of the Indians upon individual\nallotments, and the restoration to the public domain of lands in excess of\ntheir needs have been largely carried into effect so far as the work was\nconfided to the Executive. Agreements have been concluded since March 4,\n1889, involving the cession to the United States of about 14,726,000 acres\nof land. These contracts have, as required by law, been submitted to\nCongress for ratification and for the appropriations necessary to carry\nthem into effect. Those with the Sisseton and Wahpeton, Sac and Fox, Iowa,\nPottawatomies and Absentee Shawnees, and Coeur d'Alene tribes have not yet\nreceived the sanction of Congress. Attention is also called to the fact\nthat the appropriations made in the case of the Sioux Indians have not\ncovered all the stipulated payments. This should be promptly corrected. If\nan agreement is confirmed, all of its terms should be complied with without\ndelay and full appropriations should be made.The policy outlined in my last annual message in relation to the patenting\nof lands to settlers upon the public domain has been carried out in the\nadministration of the Land Office. No general suspicion or imputation of\nfraud has been allowed to delay the hearing and adjudication of individual\ncases upon their merits. The purpose has been to perfect the title of\nhonest settlers with such promptness that the value of the entry might not\nbe swallowed up by the expense and extortions to which delay subjected the\nclaimant. The average monthly issue of agricultural patents has been\nincreased about 6,000.The disability-pension act, which was approved on the 27th of June last,\nhas been put into operation as rapidly as was practicable. The increased\nclerical force provided was selected and assigned to work, and a\nconsiderable part of the force engaged in examinations in the field was\nrecalled and added to the working force of the office. The examination and\nadjudication of claims have by reason of improved methods been more rapid\nthan ever before. There is no economy to the Government in delay, while\nthere is much hardship and injustice to the soldier. The anticipated\nexpenditure, while very large, will not, it is believed, be in excess of\nthe estimates made before the enactment of the law. This liberal\nenlargement of the general law should suggest a more careful scrutiny of\nbills for special relief, both as to the cases where relief is granted and\nas to the amount allowed.The increasing numbers and influence of the non-Mormon population of Utah\nare observed with satisfaction. The recent letter of Wilford Woodruff,\npresident of the Mormon Church, in which he advised his people \"to refrain\nfrom contracting any marriage forbidden by the laws of the land,\" has\nattracted wide attention, and it is hoped that its influence will be highly\nbeneficial in restraining infractions of the laws of the United States. But\nthe fact should not be overlooked that the doctrine or belief of the church\nthat polygamous marriages are rightful and supported by divine revelation\nremains unchanged. President Woodruff does not renounce the doctrine, but\nrefrains from teaching it, and advises against the practice of it because\nthe law is against it. Now, it is quite true that the law should not\nattempt to deal with the faith or belief of anyone; but it is quite another\nthing, and the only safe thing, so to deal with the Territory of Utah as\nthat those who believe polygamy to be rightful shall not have the power to\nmake it lawful.The admission of the States of Wyoming and Idaho to the Union are events\nfull of interest and congratulation, not only to the people of those States\nnow happily endowed with a full participation in our privileges and\nresponsibilities, but to all our people. Another belt of States stretches\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific.The work of the Patent Office has won from all sources very high\ncommendation. The amount accomplished has been very largely increased, and\nall the results have been such as to secure confidence and consideration\nfor the suggestions of the Commissioner.The enumeration of the people of the United States under the provisions of\nthe act of March 1, 1889, has been completed, and the result will be at\nonce officially communicated to Congress. The completion of this decennial\nenumeration devolves upon Congress the duty of making a new apportionment\nof Representatives \"among the several States according to their respective\nnumbers.\"At the last session I had occasion to return with my objections several\nbills making provisions for the erection of public buildings for the reason\nthat the expenditures contemplated were, in my opinion, greatly in excess\nof any public need. No class of legislation is more liable to abuse or to\ndegenerate into an unseemly scramble about the public Treasury than this.\nThere should be exercised in this matter a wise economy, based upon some\nresponsible and impartial examination and report as to each case, under a\ngeneral law.The report of the Secretary of Agriculture deserves especial attention in\nview of the fact that the year has been marked in a very unusual degree by\nagitation and organization among the farmers looking to an increase in the\nprofits of their business. It will be found that the efforts of the\nDepartment have been intelligently and zealously devoted to the promotion\nof the interests intrusted to its care.A very substantial improvement in the market prices of the leading farm\nproducts during the year is noticed. The price of wheat advanced from 81\ncents in October, 1889, to $1.00 3/4 in October, 1890; corn from 31 cents\nto 50 1/4 cents; oats from 19 1/4 cents to 43 cents, and barley from 63\ncents to 78 cents. Meats showed a substantial but not so large an increase.\nThe export trade in live animals and fowls shows a very large increase. The\ntotal value of such exports for the year ending June 30, 1890, was\n$33,000,000, and the increase over the preceding year was over $15,000,000.\nNearly 200,000 more cattle and over 45,000 more hogs were exported than in\nthe preceding year. The export trade in beef and pork products and in dairy\nproducts was very largely increased, the increase in the article of butter\nalone being from 15,504,978 pounds to 29,748,042 pounds, and the total\nincrease in the value of meat and dairy products exported being\n$34,000,000. This trade, so directly helpful to the farmer, it is believed,\nwill be yet further and very largely increased when the system of\ninspection and sanitary supervision now provided by law is brought fully\ninto operation.The efforts of the Secretary to establish the healthfulness of our meats\nagainst the disparaging imputations that have been put upon them abroad\nhave resulted in substantial progress. Veterinary surgeons sent out by the\nDepartment are now allowed to participate in the inspection of the live\ncattle from this country landed at the English docks, and during the\nseveral months they have been on duty no case of contagious\npleuro-pneumonia has been reported. This inspection abroad and the domestic\ninspection of live animals and pork products provided for by the act of\nAugust 30, 1890, will afford as perfect a guaranty for the wholesomeness of\nour meats offered for foreign consumption as is anywhere given to any food\nproduct, and its nonacceptance will quite clearly reveal the real motive of\nany continued restriction of their use, and that having been made clear the\nduty of the Executive will be very plain.The information given by the Secretary of the progress and prospects of the\nbeet-sugar industry is full of interest. It has already passed the\nexperimental stage and is a commercial success. The area over which the\nsugar beet can be successfully cultivated is very large, and another field\ncrop of great value is offered to the choice of the farmer.The Secretary of the Treasury concurs in the recommendation of the\nSecretary of Agriculture that the official supervision provided by the\ntariff law for sugar of domestic production shall be transferred to the\nDepartment of Agriculture.The law relating to the civil service has, so far as I can learn, been\nexecuted by those having the power of appointment in the classified service\nwith fidelity and impartiality, and the service has been increasingly\nsatisfactory. The report of the Commission shows a large amount of good\nwork done during the year with very limited appropriations.I congratulate the Congress and the country upon the passage at the first\nsession of the Fifty-first Congress of an unusual number of laws of very\nhigh importance. That the results of this legislation will be the\nquickening and enlargement of our manufacturing industries, larger and\nbetter markets for our breadstuffs and provisions both at home and abroad,\nmore constant employment and better wages for our working people, and an\nincreased supply of a safe currency for the transaction of business, I do\nnot doubt. Some of these measures were enacted at so late a period that the\nbeneficial effects upon commerce which were in the contemplation of\nCongress have as yet but partially manifested themselves.The general trade and industrial conditions throughout the country during\nthe year have shown a marked improvement. For many years prior to 1888 the\nmerchandise balances of foreign trade had been largely in our favor, but\nduring that year and the year following they turned against us. It is very\ngratifying to know that the last fiscal year again shows a balance in our\nfavor of over $68,000,000. The bank clearings, which furnish a good test of\nthe volume of business transacted, for the first ten months of the year\n1890 show as compared with the same months of 1889 an increase for the\nwhole country of about 8.4 per cent, while the increase outside of the city\nof New York was over 13 per cent. During the month of October the clearings\nof the whole country showed an increase of 3.1 per cent over October, 1889,\nwhile outside of New York the increase was 11.5 per cent. These figures\nshow that the increase in the volume of business was very general\nthroughout the country. That this larger business was being conducted upon\na safe and profitable basis is shown by the fact that there were 300 less\nfailures reported in October, 1890, than in the same month of the preceding\nyear, with liabilities diminished by about $5,000,000.The value of our exports of domestic merchandise during the last year was\nover $115,000,000 greater than the preceding year, and was only exceeded\nonce in our history. About $100,000,000 of this excess was in agricultural\nproducts. The production of pig iron, always a good gauge of general\nprosperity, is shown by a recent census bulletin to have been 153 per cent\ngreater in 1890 than in 1880, and the production of steel 290 per cent\ngreater. Mining in coal has had no limitation except that resulting from\ndeficient transportation. The general testimony is that labor is everywhere\nfully employed, and the reports for the last year show a smaller number of\nemployees affected by strikes and lockouts than in any year since 1884. The\ndepression in the prices of agricultural products had been greatly relieved\nand a buoyant and hopeful tone was beginning to be felt by all our people.These promising influences have been in some degree checked by the\nsurprising and very unfavorable monetary events which have recently taken\nplace in England. It is gratifying to know that these did not grow in any\ndegree out of the financial relations of London with our people or out of\nany discredit attached to our securities held in that market. The return of\nour bonds and stocks was caused by a money stringency in England, not by\nany loss of value or credit in the securities themselves. We could not,\nhowever, wholly escape the ill effects of a foreign monetary agitation\naccompanied by such extraordinary incidents as characterized this. It is\nnot believed, however, that these evil incidents, which have for the time\nunfavorably affected values in this country, can long withstand the strong,\nsafe, and wholesome influences which are operating to give to our people\nprofitable returns in all branches of legitimate trade and industry. The\napprehension that our tariff may again and at once be subjected to\nimportant general changes would undoubtedly add a depressing influence of\nthe most serious character.The general tariff act has only partially gone into operation, some of its\nimportant provisions being limited to take effect at dates yet in the\nfuture. The general provisions of the law have been in force less than\nsixty days. Its permanent effects upon trade and prices still largely stand\nin conjecture. It is curious to note that the advance in the prices of\narticles wholly unaffected by the tariff act was by many hastily ascribed\nto that act. Notice was not taken of the fact that the general tendency of\nthe markets was upward, from influences wholly apart from the recent tariff\nlegislation. The enlargement of our currency by the silver bill undoubtedly\ngave an upward tendency to trade and had a marked effect on prices; but\nthis natural and desired effect of the silver legislation was by many\nerroneously attributed to the tariff act.There is neither wisdom nor justice in the suggestion that the subject of\ntariff revision shall be again opened before this law has had a fair trial.\nIt is quite true that every tariff schedule is subject to objections. No\nbill was ever framed, I suppose, that in all of its rates and\nclassifications had the full approval even of a party caucus. Such\nlegislation is always and necessarily the product of compromise as to\ndetails, and the present law is no exception. But in its general scope and\neffect I think it will justify the support of those who believe that\nAmerican legislation should conserve and defend American trade and the\nwages of American workmen.The misinformation as to the terms of the act which has been so widely\ndisseminated at home and abroad will be corrected by experience, and the\nevil auguries as to its results confounded by the market reports, the\nsavings banks, international trade balances, and the general prosperity of\nour people. Already we begin to hear from abroad and from our customhouses\nthat the prohibitory effect upon importations imputed to the act is not\njustified. The imports at the port of New York for the first three weeks of\nNovember were nearly 8 per cent greater than for the same period in 1889\nand 29 per cent greater than in the same period of 1888. And so far from\nbeing an act to limit exports, I confidently believe that under it we shall\nsecure a larger and more profitable participation in foreign trade than we\nhave ever enjoyed, and that we shall recover a proportionate participation\nin the ocean carrying trade of the world.The criticisms of the bill that have come to us from foreign sources may\nwell be rejected for repugnancy. If these critics really believe that the\nadoption by us of a free-trade policy, or of tariff rates having reference\nsolely to revenue, would diminish the participation of their own countries\nin the commerce of the world, their advocacy and promotion, by speech and\nother forms of organized effort, of this movement among our people is a\nrare exhibition of unselfishness in trade. And, on the other hand, if they\nsincerely believe that the adoption of a protective-tariff policy by this\ncountry inures to their profit and our hurt, it is noticeably strange that\nthey should lead the outcry against the authors of a policy so helpful to\ntheir countrymen and crown with their favor those who would snatch from\nthem a substantial share of a trade with other lands already inadequate to\ntheir necessities.There is no disposition among any of our people to promote prohibitory or\nretaliatory legislation. Our policies are adopted not to the hurt of\nothers, but to secure for ourselves those advantages that fairly grow out\nof our favored position as a nation. Our form of government, with its\nincident of universal suffrage, makes it imperative that we shall save our\nworking people from the agitations and distresses which scant work and\nwages that have no margin for comfort always beget. But after all this is\ndone it will be found that our markets are open to friendly commercial\nexchanges of enormous value to the other great powers.From the time of my induction into office the duty of using every power and\ninfluence given by law to the executive department for the development of\nlarger markets for our products, especially our farm products, has been\nkept constantly in mind, and no effort has been or will be spared to\npromote that end. We are under no disadvantage in any foreign market,\nexcept that we pay our workmen and workwomen better wages than are paid\nelsewhere--better abstractly, better relatively to the cost of the\nnecessaries of life. I do not doubt that a very largely increased foreign\ntrade is accessible to us without bartering for it either our home market\nfor such products of the farm and shop as our own people can supply or the\nwages of our working people.In many of the products of wood and iron and in meats and breadstuffs we\nhave advantages that only need better facilities of intercourse and\ntransportation to secure for them large foreign markets. The reciprocity\nclause of the tariff act wisely and effectively opens the way to secure a\nlarge reciprocal trade in exchange for the free admission to our ports of\ncertain products. The right of independent nations to make special\nreciprocal trade concessions is well established, and does not impair\neither the comity due to other powers or what is known as the\n\"favored-nation clause,\" so generally found in commercial treaties. What is\ngiven to one for an adequate agreed consideration can not be claimed by\nanother freely. The state of the revenues was such that we could dispense\nwith any import duties upon coffee, tea, hides, and the lower grades of\nsugar and molasses. That the large advantage resulting to the countries\nproducing and exporting these articles by placing them on the free list\nentitled us to expect a fair return in the way of customs concessions upon\narticles exported by us to them was so obvious that to have gratuitously\nabandoned this opportunity to enlarge our trade would have been an\nunpardonable error.There were but two methods of maintaining control of this question open to\nCongress--to place all of these articles upon the dutiable list, subject to\nsuch treaty agreements as could be secured, or to place them all presently\nupon the free list, but subject to the reimposition of specified duties if\nthe countries from which we received them should refuse to give to us\nsuitable reciprocal benefits. This latter method, I think, possesses great\nadvantages. It expresses in advance the consent of Congress to reciprocity\narrangements affecting these products, which must otherwise have been\ndelayed and unascertained until each treaty was ratified by the Senate and\nthe necessary legislation enacted by Congress. Experience has shown that\nsome treaties looking to reciprocal trade have failed to secure a\ntwo-thirds vote in the Senate for ratification, and others having passed\nthat stage have for years awaited the concurrence of the House and Senate\nin such modifications of our revenue laws as were necessary to give effect\nto their provisions. We now have the concurrence of both Houses in advance\nin a distinct and definite offer of free entry to our ports of specific\narticles. The Executive is not required to deal in conjecture as to what\nCongress will accept. Indeed, this reciprocity provision is more than an\noffer. Our part of the bargain is complete; delivery has been made; and\nwhen the countries from which we receive sugar, coffee, tea, and hides have\nplaced on their free lists such of our products as shall be agreed upon as\nan equivalent for our concession, a proclamation of that fact completes the\ntransaction; and in the meantime our own people have free sugar, tea,\ncoffee, and hides.The indications thus far given are very hopeful of early and favorable\naction by the countries from which we receive our large imports of coffee\nand sugar, and it is confidently believed that if steam communication with\nthese countries can be promptly improved and enlarged the next year will\nshow a most gratifying increase in our exports of breadstuffs and\nprovisions, as well as of some important lines of manufactured goods.In addition to the important bills that became laws before the adjournment\nof the last session, some other bills of the highest importance were well\nadvanced toward a final vote and now stand upon the calendars of the two\nHouses in favored positions. The present session has a fixed limit, and if\nthese measures are not now brought to a final vote all the work that has\nbeen done upon them by this Congress is lost. The proper consideration of\nthese, of an apportionment bill, and of the annual appropriation bills will\nrequire not only that no working day of the session shall be lost, but that\nmeasures of minor and local interest shall not be allowed to interrupt or\nretard the progress of those that are of universal interest. In view of\nthese conditions, I refrain from bringing before you at this time some\nsuggestions that would otherwise be made, and most earnestly invoke your\nattention to the duty of perfecting the important legislation now well\nadvanced. To some of these measures, which seem to me most important, I now\nbriefly call your attention.I desire to repeat with added urgency the recommendations contained in my\nlast annual message in relation to the development of American steamship\nlines. The reciprocity clause of the tariff bill will be largely limited\nand its benefits retarded and diminished if provision is not\ncontemporaneously made to encourage the establishment of first-class steam\ncommunication between our ports and the ports of such nations as may meet\nour overtures for enlarged commercial exchanges. The steamship, carrying\nthe mails statedly and frequently and offering to passengers a comfortable,\nsafe, and speedy transit, is the first condition of foreign trade. It\ncarries the order or the buyer, but not all that is ordered or bought. It\ngives to the sailing vessels such cargoes as are not urgent or perishable,\nand, indirectly at least, promotes that important adjunct of commerce.\nThere is now both in this country and in the nations of Central and South\nAmerica a state of expectation and confidence as to increased trade that\nwill give a double value to your prompt action upon this question.The present situation of our mail communication with Australia illustrates\nthe importance of early action by Congress. The Oceanic Steamship Company\nmaintains a line of steamers between San Francisco, Sydney, and Auckland\nconsisting of three vessels, two of which are of United States registry and\none of foreign registry. For the service done by this line in carrying the\nmails we pay annually the sum of $46,000, being, as estimated, the full sea\nand United States inland postage, which is the limit fixed by law. The\ncolonies of New South Wales and New Zealand have been paying annually to\nthese lines lbs. 37,000 for carrying the mails from Sydney and Auckland to\nSan Francisco. The contract under which this payment has been made is now\nabout to expire, and those colonies have refused to renew the contract\nunless the United States shall pay a more equitable proportion of the whole\nsum necessary to maintain the service.I am advised by the Postmaster-General that the United States receives for\ncarrying the Australian mails, brought to San Francisco in these steamers,\nby rail to Vancouver, an estimated annual income of $75,000, while, as I\nhave stated, we are paying out for the support of the steamship line that\nbrings this mail to us only $46,000, leaving an annual surplus resulting\nfrom this service of $29,000. The trade of the United States with\nAustralia, which is in a considerable part carried by these steamers, and\nthe whole of which is practically dependent upon the mail communication\nwhich they maintain, is largely in our favor. Our total exports of\nmerchandise to Australasian ports during the fiscal year ending June 30,\n1890, were $11,266,484, while the total imports of merchandise from these\nports were only $4,277,676. If we are not willing to see this important\nsteamship line withdrawn, or continued with Vancouver substituted for San\nFrancisco as the American terminal, Congress should put it in the power of\nthe Postmaster-General to make a liberal increase in the amount now paid\nfor the transportation of this important mail.The South Atlantic and Gulf ports occupy a very favored position toward the\nnew and important commerce which the reciprocity clause of the tariff act\nand the postal shipping bill are designed to promote. Steamship lines from\nthese ports to some northern port of South America will almost certainly\neffect a connection between the railroad systems of the continents long\nbefore any continuous line of railroads can be put into operation. The very\nlarge appropriation made at the last session for the harbor of Galveston\nwas justified, as it seemed to me, by these considerations. The great\nNorthwest will feel the advantage of trunk lines to the South as well as to\nthe East and of the new markets opened for their surplus food products and\nfor many of their manufactured products.I had occasion in May last to transmit to Congress a report adopted by the\nInternational American Conference upon the subject of the incorporation of\nan international American bank, with a view to facilitating money exchanges\nbetween the States represented in that conference. Such an institution\nwould greatly promote the trade we are seeking to develop. I renew the\nrecommendation that a careful and well-guarded charter be granted. I do not\nthink the powers granted should include those ordinarily exercised by\ntrust, guaranty, and safe-deposit companies, or that more branches in the\nUnited States should be authorized than are strictly necessary to\naccomplish the object primarily in view, namely, convenient foreign\nexchanges. It is quite important that prompt action should be taken in this\nmatter, in order that any appropriations for better communication with\nthese countries and any agreements that may be made for reciprocal trade\nmay not be hindered by the inconvenience of making exchanges through\nEuropean money centers or burdened by the tribute which is an incident of\nthat method of business.The bill for the relief of the Supreme Court has after many years of\ndiscussion reached a position where final action is easily attainable, and\nit is hoped that any differences of opinion may be so harmonized as to save\nthe essential features of this very important measure. In this connection I\nearnestly renew my recommendation that the salaries of the judges of the\nUnited States district courts be so readjusted that none of them shall\nreceive less than $5,000 per annum.The subject of the unadjusted Spanish and Mexican land grants and the\nurgent necessity for providing some commission or tribunal for the trial of\nquestions of title growing out of them were twice brought by me to the\nattention of Congress at the last session. Bills have been reported from\nthe proper committees in both Houses upon the subject, and I very earnestly\nhope that this Congress will put an end to the delay which has attended the\nsettlement of the disputes as to the title between the settlers and the\nclaimants under these grants. These disputes retard the prosperity and\ndisturb the peace of large and important communities. The governor of New\nMexico in his last report to the Secretary of the Interior suggests some\nmodifications of the provisions of the pending bills relating to the small\nholdings of farm lands. I commend to your attention the suggestions of the\nSecretary of the Interior upon this subject.The enactment of a national bankrupt law I still regard as very desirable.\nThe Constitution having given to Congress jurisdiction of this subject, it\nshould be exercised and uniform rules provided for the administration of\nthe affairs of insolvent debtors. The inconveniences resulting from the\noccasional and temporary exercise of this power by Congress and from the\nconflicting State codes of insolvency which come into force intermediately\nshould be removed by the enactment of a simple, inexpensive, and permanent\nnational bankrupt law.I also renew my recommendation in favor of legislation affording just\ncopyright protection to foreign authors on a footing of reciprocal\nadvantage for our authors abroad.It may still be possible for this Congress to inaugurate by suitable\nlegislation a movement looking to uniformity and increased safety in the\nuse of couplers and brakes upon freight trains engaged in interstate\ncommerce. The chief difficulty in the way is to secure agreement as to the\nbest appliances, simplicity, effectiveness, and cost being considered. This\ndifficulty will only yield to legislation, which should be based upon full\ninquiry and impartial tests. The purpose should be to secure the\ncooperation of all well-disposed managers and owners; but the fearful fact\nthat every year's delay involves the sacrifice of 2,000 lives and the\nmaiming of 20,000 young men should plead both with Congress and the\nmanagers against any needless delay.The subject of the conservation and equal distribution of the water supply\nof the arid regions has had much attention from Congress, but has not as\nyet been put upon a permanent and satisfactory basis. The urgency of the\nsubject does not grow out of any large present demand for the use of these\nlands for agriculture, but out of the danger that the water supply and the\nsites for the necessary catch basins may fall into the hands of individuals\nor private corporations and be used to render subservient the large areas\ndependent upon such supply. The owner of the water is the owner of the\nlands, however the titles may run. All unappropriated natural water sources\nand all necessary reservoir sites should be held by the Government for the\nequal use at fair rates of the homestead settlers who will eventually take\nup these lands. The United States should not, in my opinion, undertake the\nconstruction of dams or canals, but should limit its work to such surveys\nand observations as will determine the water supply, both surface and\nsubterranean, the areas capable of irrigation, and the location and storage\ncapacity of reservoirs. This done, the use of the water and of the\nreservoir sites might be granted to the respective States or Territories or\nto individuals or associations upon the condition that the necessary works\nshould be constructed and the water furnished at fair rates without\ndiscrimination, the rates to be subject to supervision by the legislatures\nor by boards of water commissioners duly constituted. The essential thing\nto be secured is the common and equal use at fair rates of the accumulated\nwater supply. It were almost better that these lands should remain arid\nthan that those who occupy them should become the slaves of unrestrained\nmonopolies controlling the one essential element of land values and crop\nresults.The use of the telegraph by the Post-Office Department as a means for the\nrapid transmission of written communications is, I believe, upon proper\nterms, quite desirable. The Government does not own or operate the\nrailroads, and it should not, I think, own or operate the telegraph lines.\nIt does, however, seem to be quite practicable for the Government to\ncontract with the telegraph companies, as it does with railroad companies,\nto carry at specified rates such communications as the senders may\ndesignate for this method of transmission. I recommend that such\nlegislation be enacted as will enable the Post-Office Department fairly to\ntest by experiment the advantages of such a use of the telegraph.If any intelligent and loyal company of American citizens were required to\ncatalogue the essential human conditions of national life, I do not doubt\nthat with absolute unanimity they would begin with \"free and honest\nelections.\" And it is gratifying to know that generally there is a growing\nand nonpartisan demand for better election laws; but against this sign of\nhope and progress must be set the depressing and undeniable fact that\nelection laws and methods are sometimes cunningly contrived to secure\nminority control, while violence completes the shortcomings of fraud.In my last annual message I suggested that the development of the existing\nlaw providing a Federal supervision of Congressional elections offered an\neffective method of reforming these abuses. The need of such a law has\nmanifested itself in many parts of the country, and its wholesome\nrestraints and penalties will be useful in all. The constitutionality of\nsuch legislation has been affirmed by the Supreme Court. Its probable\neffectiveness is evidenced by the character of the opposition that is made\nto it. It has been denounced as if it were a new exercise of Federal power\nand an invasion of the rights of States. Nothing could be further from the\ntruth. Congress has already fixed the time for the election of members of\nCongress. It has declared that votes for members of Congress must be by\nwritten or printed ballot; it has provided for the appointment by the\ncircuit courts in certain cases, and upon the petition of a certain number\nof citizens, of election supervisors, and made it their duty to supervise\nthe registration of voters conducted by the State officers; to challenge\npersons offering to register; to personally inspect and scrutinize the\nregistry lists, and to affix their names to the lists for the purpose of\nidentification and the prevention of frauds; to attend at elections and\nremain with the boxes till they are all cast and counted; to attach to the\nregistry lists and election returns any statement touching the accuracy and\nfairness of the registry and election, and to take and transmit to the\nClerk of the House of Representatives any evidence of fraudulent practices\nwhich may be presented to them. The same law provides for the appointment\nof deputy United States marshals to attend at the polls, support the\nsupervisors in the discharge of their duties, and to arrest persons\nviolating the election laws. The provisions of this familiar title of the\nRevised Statutes have been put into exercise by both the great political\nparties, and in the North as well as in the South, by the filing with the\ncourt of the petitions required by the law.It is not, therefore, a question whether we shall have a Federal election\nlaw, for we now have one and have had for nearly twenty years, but whether\nwe shall have an effective law. The present law stops just short of\neffectiveness, for it surrenders to the local authorities all control over\nthe certification which establishes the prima facie right to a seat in the\nHouse of Representatives. This defect should be cured. Equality of\nrepresentation and the parity of the electors must be maintained or\neverything that is valuable in our system of government is lost. The\nqualifications of an elector must be sought in the law, net in the\nopinions, prejudices, or fears of any class, however powerful. The path of\nthe elector to the ballot box must be free from the ambush of fear and the\nenticements of fraud; the count so true and open that none shall gainsay\nit. Such a law should be absolutely nonpartisan and impartial. It should\ngive the advantage to honesty and the control to majorities. Surely there\nis nothing sectional about this creed, and if it shall happen that the\npenalties of laws intended to enforce these rights fall here and not there\nit is not because the law is sectional, but because, happily, crime is\nlocal and not universal. Nor should it be forgotten that every law, whether\nrelating to elections or to any other subject, whether enacted by the State\nor by the nation, has force behind it; the courts, the marshal or\nconstable, the posse comitatus, the prison, are all and always behind the\nlaw.One can not be justly charged with unfriendliness to any section or class\nwho seeks only to restrain violations of law and of personal right. No\ncommunity will find lawlessness profitable. No community can afford to have\nit known that the officers who are charged with the preservation of the\npublic peace and the restraint of the criminal classes are themselves the\nproduct of fraud or violence. The magistrate is then without respect and\nthe law without sanction. The floods of lawlessness can not be leveed and\nmade to run in one channel. The killing of a United States marshal carrying\na writ of arrest for an election offense is full of prompting and\nsuggestion to men who are pursued by a city marshal for a crime against\nlife or property.But it is said that this legislation will revive race animosities, and some\nhave even suggested that when the peaceful methods of fraud are made\nimpossible they may be supplanted by intimidation and violence. If the\nproposed law gives to any qualified elector by a hair's weight more than\nhis equal influence or detracts by so much from any other qualified\nelector, it is fatally impeached. But if the law is equal and the\nanimosities it is to evoke grow out of the fact that some electors have\nbeen accustomed to exercise the franchise for others as well as for\nthemselves, then these animosities ought not to be confessed without shame,\nand can not be given any weight in the discussion without dishonor No\nchoice is left to me but to enforce with vigor all laws intended to secure\nto the citizen his constitutional rights and to recommend that the\ninadequacies of such laws be promptly remedied. If to promote with zeal and\nready interest every project for the development of its material interests,\nits rivers, harbors, mines, and factories, and the intelligence, peace, and\nsecurity under the law of its communities and its homes is not accepted as\nsufficient evidence of friendliness to any State or section, I can not add\nconnivance at election practices that not only disturb local results, but\nrob the electors of other States and sections of their most priceless\npolitical rights.The preparation of the general appropriation bills should be conducted with\nthe greatest care and the closest scrutiny of expenditures. Appropriations\nshould be adequate to the needs of the public service, but they should be\nabsolutely free from prodigality.I venture again to remind you that the brief time remaining for the\nconsideration of the important legislation now awaiting your attention\noffers no margin for waste. If the present duty is discharged with\ndiligence, fidelity, and courage, the work of the Fifty-first Congress may\nbe confidently submitted to the considerate judgment of the people.
