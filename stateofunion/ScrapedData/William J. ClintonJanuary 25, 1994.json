    "speech": "Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, members of the 103rd Congress, my fellow\nAmericans:I am not sure what speech is in the TelePrompTer tonight, but I hope we can\ntalk about the State of the Union.I ask you to begin by recalling the memory of the giant who presided over\nthis chamber with such force and grace. Tip O'Neill liked to call himself\n\"A Man of the House\" and he surely was that. But even more, he was a man of\nthe people, a bricklayer's son who helped to build the great American\nmiddle class. Tip O'Neill never forgot who he was, where he came from, or\nwho sent him here. Tonight he's smiling down on us for the first time from\nthe Lord's gallery. But in his honor, may we too also remember who we are,\nwhere we come from, and who sent us here.If we do that we will return over and over again to the principle that if\nwe simply give ordinary people equal opportunity, quality education, and a\nfair shot at the American dream, they will do extraordinary things.We gather tonight in a world of changes so profound and rapid that all\nnations are tested. Our American heritage has always been to master such\nchange, to use it to expand opportunity at home, and our leadership abroad.\nBut for too long and in too many ways, that heritage was abandoned, and our\ncountry drifted.For 30 years family life in America has been breaking down. For 20 years\nthe wages of working people have been stagnant or declining. For the 12\nyears of trickle down economics we built a false prosperity on a hollow\nbase as our national debt quadrupled. From 1989 to 1992 we experienced the\nslowest growth in a half century. For too many families, even when both\nparents were working, the American dream has been slipping away.In 1992 the American people demanded that we change. I year ago I asked all\nof you to join me in accepting responsibility for the future of our\ncountry.Well, we did. We replaced drift and deadlock with renewal and reform. And I\nwant to thank every one of you here who heard the American people, who\nbroke gridlock, who gave them the most successful teamwork between a\npresident and a Congress in 30 years.AccomplishmentsThis Congress produced a budget that cut the deficit by half a trillion\ndollars, cut spending and raised income taxes on only the wealthiest\nAmericans. This Congress produced tax relief for millions of low-income\nworkers to reward work over welfare. It produced NAFTA. It produced the\nBrady bill, now the Brady law.And thank you, Jim Brady, for being here, and God bless you, Sarah. This\nCongress produced tax cuts to reduce the taxes of nine out of 10 small\nbusinesses who use the money to invest more and create more jobs. It\nproduced more research and treatment for AIDS, more childhood\nimmunizations, more support for women's health research, more affordable\ncollege loans for the middle class, a new national service program for\nthose who want to give something back to their country and their\ncommunities for higher education, a dramatic increase in high-tech\ninvestments to move us from a defense to a domestic high-tech economy. This\nCongress produced a new law--the motor voter bill--to help millions of\npeople register to vote. It produced family and medical leave--all passed,\nall signed into law, with not one single veto.These accomplishments were all commitments I made when I sought this\noffice, and in fairness, they all had to be passed by you in this Congress.\nBut I am persuaded that the real credit belongs to the people who sent us\nhere, who pay our salaries, who hold our feet to the fire. But what we do\nhere is really beginning to change lives. Let me just give you one\nexample.Family And Medical LeaveI will never forget what the family and medical leave law meant to just one\nfather I met early one Sunday morning in the White House. It was unusual to\nsee a family there touring early Sunday morning, but he had his wife and\nhis three children there, one of them in a wheelchair. And I came up, and\nafter we had our picture taken and had a little visit, I was walking off,\nand that man grabbed me by the arm and he said, \"Mr. President, let me tell\nyou something. My little girl here is desperately ill. She's probably not\ngoing to make it. But because of the family leave law, I was able to take\ntime off to spend with her, the most important I ever spent in my life,\nwithout losing my job and hurting the rest of my family. It means more to\nme than I will ever be able to say. Don't you people up here ever think\nwhat you do doesn't make a difference. It does.\"Though we are making a difference, our work has just begun. Many Americans\nstill haven't felt the impact of what we've done. The recovery still hasn't\ntouched every community or created enough jobs. Incomes are still stagnant.\nThere's still too much violence and not enough hope in too many places.Abroad, the young democracies we are strongly supporting still face very\ndifficult times and look to us for leadership.And so tonight, let us resolve to continue the journey of renewal, to\ncreate more and better jobs, to guarantee health security for all, to\nreward welfare--work over welfare, to promote democracy abroad and to\nbegin to reclaim our streets from violent crime and drugs and gangs to\nrenew our own American community.Deficit ReductionLast year, we began to put our house in order by tackling the budget\ndeficit that was driving us toward bankruptcy. We cut $255 billion in\nspending, including entitlements, in over 340 separate budget items. We\nfroze domestic spending and used honest budget numbers.Led by the vice president, we've launched a campaign to reinvent\ngovernment. We've cut staff, cut perks, even trimmed the fleet of federal\nlimousines. After years of leaders whose rhetoric attacked bureaucracy but\nwhose actions expanded it, we will actually reduce it by 252,000 people\nover the next five years. By the time we have finished, the federal\nbureaucracy will be at its lowest point in 30 years.Because the deficit was so large and because they benefited from tax cuts\nin the 1980s, we did ask the wealthiest Americans to pay more to reduce the\ndeficit. So on April the 15th, the American people will discover the truth\nabout what we did last year on taxes. Only the top one--the top 1.2\npercent of Americans, as I said all along, will face higher income tax\nrates--let me repeat, only the wealthiest 1.2 percent of Americans will\nface higher income tax rates and no one else will, and that is the truth.\nOf course, there were, as there always are in politics, naysayers who said\nthis plan wouldn't work, but they were wrong. When I became president, the\nexperts predicted that next year's deficit would be $300 billion, but\nbecause we acted, those same people now say the deficit's going to be under\n$180 billion, 40 percent lower than was previously predicted.The EconomyOur economic program has helped to produce the lowest core inflation rate\nand the lowest interest rates in 20 years, and because those interest rates\nare down, business investment and equipment is growing at seven times the\nrate of the previous four years. Auto sales are way up, home sales at a\nrecord high. Millions of Americans have refinanced their homes and our\neconomy has produced 1.6 million private-sector jobs in 1993, more than\nwere created in the previous four years combined.The people who supported this economic plan should be proud of its early\nresults--proud. But everyone in this chamber should know and acknowledge\nthat there is more to do. Next month I will send you one of the toughest\nbudgets ever presented to Congress. It will cut spending in more than 300\nprograms, eliminate 100 domestic programs, and reforms the way in which\ngovernments buy goods and services.This year we must again make the hard choices to live within the hard\nspending ceilings we have set. We must do it. We have proved we can bring\nthe deficit down without choking off recovery, without punishing seniors or\nthe middle class, and without putting our national security at risk. If you\nwill stick with this plan, we will post three consecutive years of\ndeclining deficits for the first time since Harry Truman lived in the White\nHouse. And once again, the buck stops here.TradeOur economic plan also bolsters our strength and our credibility around the\nworld. Once we reduced the deficit and put the steel back into our\ncompetitive edge, the world echoed with the sound of falling trade\nbarriers. In one year, with NAFTA, with GATT, with our efforts in Asia and\nthe national export strategy, we did more to open world markets to American\nproducts than at any time in the last two generations. That means more jobs\nand rising living standards for the American people, low deficits, low\ninflation, low interest rates, low trade barriers and high investments.\nThese are the building blocks of our recovery. But if we want to take full\nadvantage of the opportunities before us in the global economy, you all\nknow we must do more.As we reduce defense spending, I ask Congress to invest more in the\ntechnologies of tomorrow. Defense conversion will keep us strong militarily\nand create jobs for our people here at home.As we protect our environment, we must invest in the environmental\ntechnologies of the future which will create jobs. This year we will fight\nfor a revitalized Clean Water Act and a Safe Drinking Water Act and a\nreformed Superfund program.And the vice president is right; we must also work with the private sector\nto connect every classroom, every clinic, every library, every hospital in\nAmerica into a national information superhighway by the year 2000. Think of\nit. Instant access to information will increase productivity. It will help\nto educate our children. It will provide better medical care. It will\ncreate jobs. And I call on the Congress to pass legislation to establish\nthat information superhighway this year.As we expand opportunity and create jobs, no one can be left out. We must\ncontinue to enforce fair lending and fair housing and all civil rights\nlaws, because America will never be complete in its renewal until everyone\nshares in its bounty. But we all know, too, we can do all these things--\nput our economic house in order, expand world trade, target the jobs of the\nfuture, guarantee equal opportunity.But if we're honest, we'll all admit that this strategy still cannot work\nunless we also give our people the education, training and skills they need\nto seize the opportunities of tomorrow. We must set tough, world-class\nacademic and occupational standards for all our children and give our\nteachers and students the tools they need to meet them.EducationOur Goals 2000 proposal will empower individual school districts to\nexperiment with ideas like chartering their schools to be run by private\ncorporations or having more public school choice, to do whatever they wish\nto do as long as we measure every school by one high standard: Are our\nchildren learning what they need to know to compete and win in the global\neconomy?Goals 2000 links world-class standards to grassroots reforms and I hope\nCongress will pass it without delay. Our school to work initiative will for\nthe first time link school to the world of work, providing at least one\nyear of apprenticeship beyond high school. After all, most of the people\nwe're counting on to build our economic future won't graduate from college.\nIt's time to stop ignoring them and start empowering them. We must\nliterally transform our outdated unemployment system into a new\nreemployment system. The old unemployment system just sort of kept you\ngoing while you waited for your old job to come back. We've got to have a\nnew system to move people into new and better jobs because most of those\nold jobs just don't come back. And we know that the only way to have real\njob security in the future, to get a good job with a growing income, is to\nhave real skills and the ability to learn new ones. So we've got to\nstreamline today's patchwork of training programs and make them a source of\nnew skill for our people who lose their jobs. Reemployment, not\nunemployment, must become the centerpiece of our economic renewal. I urge\nyou to pass it in this session of Congress.WelfareAnd just as we must transform our unemployment system, so must we also\nrevolutionize our welfare system. It doesn't work; it defies our values as\na nation. If we value work, we can't justify a system that makes welfare\nmore attractive than work if people are worried about losing their health\ncare.If we value responsibility, we can't ignore the $34 billion in child\nsupport absent parents out to be paying to millions of parents who are\ntaking care of their children--. If we value strong families, we can't\nperpetuate a system that actually penalizes those who stay together. Can\nyou believe that a child who has a child gets more money from the\ngovernment for leaving home than for staying home with a parent or a\ngrandparent? That's not just bad policy, it's wrong and we ought to change\nit.I worked on this problem for years before I became president, with other\ngovernors and with members of Congress in both parties and with the\nprevious administration of another party. I worked on it with people who\nwere on welfare, lots of them. And I want to say something to everybody\nhere who cares about this issue. The people who most want to change this\nsystem are the people who are dependent on it. They want to get off\nwelfare; they want to go back to work; they want to do right by their\nkids.I once had a hearing when I was a governor and I brought in people on\nwelfare from all over America who had found their way to work and a woman\nfrom my state who testified was asked this question. What's the best thing\nabout being off welfare and in a job. And without blinking an eye, she\nlooked at 40 governors and she said, when my boy goes to school and they\nsay \"What does your mother do for a living?\" he can give an answer. These\npeople want a better system and we ought to give it to them.Last year, we began this. We gave the states more power to innovate because\nwe know that a lot of great ideas come from outside Washington and many\nstates are already using it. Then this Congress took a dramatic step.\nInstead of taxing people with modest incomes into poverty, we helped them\nto work their way out of poverty by dramatically increasing the earned\nincome tax credit. It will lift 15 million working families out of poverty,\nrewarding work over welfare, making it possible for people to be successful\nworkers and successful parents. Now that's real welfare reform.But there is more to be done. This spring I will send you a comprehensive\nwelfare reform bill that builds on the Family Support Act of 1988 and\nrestores the basic values of work and responsibility. We will say to\nteenagers if you have a child out of wedlock, we'll no longer give you a\ncheck to set up a separate household, we want families to stay together;\nsay to absent parents who aren't paying their child support if you're not\nproviding for your children we'll garnish your wages, suspend your license,\ntrack you across state lines, and if necessary make some of you work off\nwhat you owe.People who bring children into this world cannot and must not walk away\nfrom them.But to all those who depend on welfare, we should offer ultimately a simple\ncompact. We will provide the support, the job training, the child care you\nneed for up to two years, but after that anyone who can work, must, in the\nprivate sector wherever possible, in community service if necessary. That's\nthe only way we'll ever make welfare what it ought to be, a second chance,\nnot a way of life.I know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the same\ntime we tackle health care. But let me point out, I think it is inevitable\nand imperative. It is estimated that one million people are on welfare\ntoday because it's the only way they can get health care coverage for their\nchildren. Those who choose to leave welfare for jobs without health\nbenefits, and many entry level jobs don't have health benefits, find\nthemselves in the incredible position of paying taxes that help to pay for\nhealth care coverage for those who made the other choice, to stay on\nwelfare. No wonder people leave work and go back to welfare, to get health\ncare coverage. We've got to solve the health care problem to have real\nwelfare reform.Health Care ReformSo this year we will make history by reforming the health care system. And\nI would say to you, all of you my fellow public servants, this is another\nissue where the people are way ahead of the politicians.That may not be popular with either party, but it happens to be the truth.You know, the first lady has received now almost a million letters from\npeople all across America and from all walks of life. I'd like to share\njust one of them with you. Richard Anderson of Reno, Nevada, lost his job\nand, with it, his health insurance. Two weeks later, his wife, Judy,\nsuffered a cerebral aneurysm. He rushed her to the hospital, where she\nstayed in intensive care for 21 days. The Anderson's bills were over\n$120,000. Although Judy recovered and Richard went back to work at $8 an\nhour, the bills were too much for them and they were literally forced into\nbankruptcy.\"Mrs. Clinton,\" he wrote to Hillary, \"no one in the United States of\nAmerica should have to lose everything they've worked for all their lives\nbecause they were unfortunate enough to become ill.\" It was to help the\nRichard and Judy Andersons of America that the first lady and so many\nothers have worked so hard and so long on this health care reform issue. We\nowe them our thanks and our action.I know there are people here who say there's no health care crisis. Tell it\nto Richard and Judy Anderson. Tell it to the 58 million Americans who have\nno coverage at all for some time each year. Tell it to the 81 million\nAmericans with those preexisting conditions; those folks are paying more or\nthey can't get insurance at all or they can't ever change their jobs\nbecause they or someone in their family has one of those preexisting\nconditions. Tell it to the small businesses burdened by skyrocketing costs\nof insurance. Most small businesses cover their employers, and they pay on\naverage 35 percent more in premiums than big businesses or government. Or\ntell it to the 76 percent of insured Americans, three out of four whose\npolicies have lifetime limits, and that means they can find themselves\nwithout any coverage at all just when they need it the most.So, if any of you believe there's no crisis, you tell it to those people,\nbecause I can't.There are some people who literally do not understand the impact of this\nproblem on people's lives, but all you have to do is go out and listen to\nthem. Just go talk to them anywhere, in any congressional district in this\ncountry. They're Republicans and Democrats and independents. It doesn't\nhave a lick to do with party. They think we don't get it, and it's time we\nshow that we do get it.From the day we began, our health care initiative has been designed to\nstrengthen what is good about our health care system--the world's best\nhealth care professionals, cutting edge research, and wonderful research\ninstitutions, Medicare for older Americans. None of this--none of it\nshould be put at risk. But we're paying more and more money for less and\nless care. Every year, fewer and fewer Americans even get to choose their\ndoctors. Every year, doctors and nurses spend more time on paperwork and\nless time with patients because of the absolute bureaucratic nightmare the\npresent system has become.This system is riddled with inefficiency, with abuse, with fraud, and\neverybody knows it. In today's health care system, insurance companies call\nthe shots. They pick whom they cover and how they cover them. They can cut\noff your benefits when you need your coverage the most. They are in\ncharge.What does it mean? It means every night millions of well-insured Americans\ngo to bed just an illness, an accident, or a pink slip away from having no\ncoverage or financial ruin. It means every morning millions of Americans go\nto work without any health insurance at all--something the workers in no\nother advanced country in the world do. It means that every year more and\nmore hard working people are told to pick a new doctor because their boss\nhas had to pick a new plan. And countless others turndown better jobs\nbecause they know, if they take the better job, they'll lose their health\ninsurance.If we just let the health care system continue to drift, our country will\nhave people with less care, fewer choices, and higher bill.Now, our approach protects the quality of care and people's choices. It\nbuilds on what works today in the private sector, to expand employer based\ncoverage, to guarantee private insurance for every American. And I might\nsay, employer based private insurance for every American was proposed 20\nyears ago by President Richard Nixon to the United States Congress. It was\na good idea then, and it's a better idea today.Why do we want guaranteed private insurance? Because right now, nine out of\nten people who have insurance get it through their employers--and that\nshould continue. And if your employer is providing good benefits at\nreasonable prices, that should continue too. And that ought to make the\nCongress and the president feel better. Our goal is health insurance\neverybody can depend on--comprehensive benefits that cover preventive care\nand prescription drugs, health premiums that don't just explode when you\nget sick or you get older, the power--no matter how small your business is\n--to choose dependable insurance at the same competitive rates that\ngovernments and big business get today, one simple form for people who are\nsick, and most of all, the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose\nyour own doctor.Our approach protects older Americans. Every plan before the Congress\nproposes to slow the growth of Medicare. The difference is this. We believe\nthose savings should be used to improve health care for senior citizens.\nMedicare must be protected, and it should cover prescription drugs, and we\nshould take the first steps in covering long-term care.To those who would cut Medicare without protecting seniors, I say the\nsolution to today's squeeze on middle class working people's health care is\nnot to put the squeeze on middle class retired people's health care. We can\ndo better than that. When it's all said and done, it's pretty simple to me.\nInsurance ought to mean what it used to mean. You pay a fair price for\nsecurity, and when you get sick, health care is always there--no matter\nwhat.Along with the guarantee of health security, we all have to admit, too,\nthere must be more responsibility on the part of all of us in how we use\nthis system. People have to take their kids to get immunized. We should all\ntake advantage of preventive care. We must all work together to stop the\nviolence that explodes our emergency rooms. We have to practice better\nhealth habits, and we can't abuse the system. And those who don't have\ninsurance under our approach will get coverage, but they will have to pay\nsomething for it, too. The minority of businesses that provide no insurance\nat all, and in so doing, shift the cost of the care of their employees to\nothers, should contribute something. People who smoke should pay more for a\npack of cigarettes. Everybody can contribute something if we want to solve\nthe health care crisis. There can't be anymore something for nothing. It\nwill not be easy, but it can be done. Now in the coming months I hope very\nmuch to work with both Democrats and Republicans to reform a health care\nsystem by using the market to bring down costs and to achieve lasting\nhealth security. But if you look at history, we see that for 60 years this\ncountry has tried to reform health care. President Roosevelt tried,\nPresident Truman tried, President Nixon tried, President Carter tried.\nEvery time the special interests were powerful enough to defeat them, but\nnot this time.Campaign Finance ReformI know that facing up to these interests will require courage. It will\nraise critical questions about the way we finance our campaigns and how\nlobbyists yield their influence. The work of change, frankly, will never\nget any easier until we limit the influence of well financed interests who\nprofit from this current system. So I also must now call on you to finish\nthe job both houses began last year, by passing tough and meaningful\ncampaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this year.You know, my fellow Americans, this is really a test for all of us. The\nAmerican people provide those of us in government service with terrific\nhealth care benefits at reasonable costs. We have health care that's always\nthere. I think we need to give every hard working, taxpaying American the\nsame health care security they have already given to us.I want to make this very clear: I am open, as I have said repeatedly, to\nthe best ideas of concerned members of both parties. I have no special\nbrief for any specific approach, even in our own bill, except this: if you\nsend me legislation that does not guarantee every American private health\ninsurance that can never be taken away, you will force me to take this pen,\nveto the legislation, and we'll come right back here and start all over\nagain.But I don't think that's going to happen. I think we're ready to act now. I\nbelieve that you're ready to act now. And if you're ready to guarantee\nevery American the same health care that you have, health care that can\nnever be taken away--now, not next year or the year after, now is the time\nto stand with the people who sent us here. Now.Foreign PolicyAs we take these steps together to renew our strength at home, we cannot\nturn away from our obligations to renew our leadership abroad. This is a\npromising moment. Because of the agreements we have reached this year, last\nyear, Russia's strategic nuclear missiles soon will no longer be pointed at\nthe United States. Nor will we point ours at them.Instead of building weapons in space, Russian scientists will help us to\nbuild the international space station.And of course there are still dangers in the world: rampant arms\nproliferation, bitter regional conflicts, ethnic and nationalist tensions\nin many new democracies, severe environmental degradation the world over,\nand fanatics who seek to cripple the world's cities with terror. As the\nworld's greatest power, we must therefore maintain our defenses and our\nresponsibilities. This year we secured indictments against terrorists and\nsanctions against those harbor them. We worked to promote\nenvironmentally-sustainable economic growth. We achieved agreements with\nUkraine, with Belarus, with Kazakhstan, to eliminate completely their\nnuclear arsenals. We are working to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of\nnuclear weapons. We will seek early ratification of the treaty to ban\nchemical weapons worldwide. And earlier today we joined with over 30\nnations to begin negotiations on a comprehensive ban to stop all nuclear\ntesting.But nothing--nothing--is more important to our security than our nation's\narmed forces. We honor their contributions, including those who are\ncarrying out the longest humanitarian airlift in history in Bosnia----\nthose who will complete their mission in Somalia this year and their brave\ncomrades who gave their lives there. Our forces are the finest military our\nnation has ever had, and I have pledged that as long as I am president they\nwill remain the best-equipped, the best-trained and the best-prepared\nfighting force on the face of the earth.DefenseLast year, I proposed a defense plan that maintains our post-Cold War\nsecurity at a lower cost. This year, many people urged me to cut our\ndefense spending further to pay for other government programs. I said no.\nThe budget I send to Congress draws the line against further defense cuts.\nIt protects the readiness and quality of our forces. Ultimately, the best\nstrategy is to do that. We must not cut defense further. I hope the\nCongress without regard to party will support that position.Ultimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable\npeace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't\nattack each other. They make better trading partners and partners in\ndiplomacy. That is why we have supported, you and I, the democratic\nreformers in Russia and in the other states of the former Soviet bloc. I\napplaud the bipartisan support this Congress provided last year for our\ninitiatives to help Russia, Ukraine and the other states through their epic\ntransformations.Our support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task\nand vigilance for our fundamental interest and values. We will continue to\nurge Russia and the other states to press ahead with economic reforms, and\nwe will seek to cooperate with Russia to solve regional problems while\ninsisting that, if Russian troops operate in neighboring states, they do so\nonly when those states agree to their presence and in strict accord with\ninternational standards.But we must also remember as these nations chart their own futures, and\nthey must chart their own futures, how much more secure and more prosperous\nour own people will be if democratic and market reform succeed all across\nthe former communist bloc. Our policy has been to support that move and\nthat has been the policy of the Congress. We should continue it.EuropeThat is why I went to Europe earlier this month, to work with our European\npartners to help to integrate all the former communist countries into a\nEurope that has the possibility of becoming unified for the first time in\nits entire history, it's entire history, based on the simple commitments of\nall nations in Europe to democracy, to free markets, and to respect for\nexisting borders.With our allies, we have created a partnership for peace that invites\nstates from the former Soviet bloc and other non-NATO members to work with\nNATO in military cooperation. When I met with Central Europe's leaders,\nincluding Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel, men who put their lives on the line\nfor freedom, I told them that the security of their region is important to\nour country's security.This year, we must also do more to support democratic renewal and human\nrights and sustainable development all around the world. We will ask\nCongress to ratify the new GATT accord, we will continue standing by South\nAfrica as it works its way through its bold and hopeful and difficult\ntransition to democracy. We will convene a summit of the Western\nhemisphere's democratic leaders from Canada to the tip of South America.\nAnd we will continue to press for the restoration of true democracy in\nHaiti.And as we build a more constructive relationship with China, we must\ncontinue to insist on clear signs of improvement in that nation's human\nrights record.Middle EastWe will also work for new progress toward the Middle East peace. Last year\nthe world watched Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat at the White House when\nthey had their historic handshake of reconciliation. But there is a long,\nhard road ahead. And on that road I am determined that I and our\nadministration will do all we can to achieve a comprehensive and lasting\npeace for all the peoples of the region.Now, there are some in our country who argue that with the Cold War,\nAmerica should turn its back on the rest of the world. Many around the\nworld were afraid we would do just that. But I took this office on a pledge\nthat had no partisan tinge to keep our nation secure by remaining engaged\nin the rest of the world. And this year, because of our work together,\nenacting NAFTA, keeping our military strong and prepared, supporting\ndemocracy abroad, we have reaffirmed America's leadership, America's\nengagement, and as a result, the American people are more secure than they\nwere before.CrimeBut while Americans are more secure from threats abroad, I think we all now\nthat in many ways we are less secure from threats here at home. Everyday\nthe national peace is shattered by crime.In Petaluma, California, an innocent slumber party gives way to agonizing\ntragedy for the family of Polly Klaas. An ordinary train ride on Long\nIsland ends in a hail of nine millimeter rounds. A tourist in Florida is\nnearly burned alive by bigots simply because he is black. Right here in our\nnation's capital, a brave young man named Jason White, a policeman, the son\nand grandson of policemen, is ruthlessly gunned down.Violent crime and the fear it provokes are crippling our society, limiting\npersonal freedom, and fraying the ties that bind us.The crime bill before Congress gives you a chance to do something about it,\na chance to be tough and smart. What does that mean? Let me begin by saying\nI care a lot about this issue. Many years ago, when I started out in public\nlife, I was the attorney general of my state. I served as a governor for a\ndozen years. I know what it's like to sign laws increasing penalties, to\nbuild more prison cells, to carry out the death penalty. I understand this\nissue and it is not a simple thing.First, we must recognize that most violent crimes are committed by a small\npercentage of criminals who too often break the laws even when they are on\nparole. Now those who commit crimes should be punished, and those who\ncommit repeated violent crimes should be told when you commit a third\nviolent crime, you will be put away and put away for good, three strikes\nand you are out.Second, we must take serious steps to reduce violence and prevent crime,\nbeginning with more police officers and more community policing. We know\nright now that police who work the streets, know the folks, have the\nrespect of the neighborhood kids, focus on high crime areas, we know that\nthey are more likely to prevent crime as well as catch criminals. Look at\nthe experience of Houston, where the crime rate dropped 17 percent in one\nyear when that approach was taken. Here tonight is one of those community\npolicemen, a brave, young detective, Kevin Jett, whose beat is eight square\nblocks in one of the toughest neighborhoods in New York. Every day he\nrestores some sanity and safety, and a sense of values and connection to\nthe people whose lives he protects. I'd like to ask him to stand up and be\nrecognized tonight.You will be given a chance to give the children of this country, the law\nabiding working people of this country, and don't forget, in the toughest\nneighborhoods in this country, in the highest crime neighborhoods in this\ncountry the vast majority of people get up every day and obey the law, pay\ntheir taxes, do their best to raise their kids. They deserve people like\nKevin Jett, and you're going to be given the chance to give the American\npeople another 100,000 of them, well trained, and I urge you to do it.You have before you crime legislation which also establishes a police corps\nto encourage young people to get an education, and pay it off by serving as\npolice officers, which encourages retiring military personnel to move into\npolice forces--and enormous resources for our country, one which has a\nsafe schools provisions which will give our young people the chance to walk\nto school in safety and to be in school in safety instead of dodging\nbullets. These are important things.The third thing we have to do is to build on the Brady Bill--the Brady Law\nto take further steps----to take further steps to keep guns out of the\nhands of criminals.Now, I want to say something about this issue. Hunters must always be free\nto hunt, law abiding adults should always be free to own guns and protect\ntheir homes. I respect that part of our culture. I grew up in it. But I\nwant to ask the sportsmen and others who lawfully own guns to join us in\nthis campaign to reduce gun violence. I say to you, I know you didn't\ncreate this problem, but we need your help to solve it. There is no\nsporting purpose on earth that should stop the United States Congress from\nbanishing assault weapons that outgun police and cut down children.Fourth, we must remember that drugs are a factor in an enormous percentage\nof crimes. Recent studies indicate, sadly, that drug use is on the rise\nagain among our young people. The Crime Bill contains--all the crime bills\ncontain--more money for drug treatment, for criminal addicts, and boot\ncamps for youthful offenders that include incentives to get off drugs and\nto stay off drugs. Our administration's budget, with all its cuts, contains\na large increase in funding for drug treatment and drug education. You must\npass them both. We need then desperately.My fellow Americans, the problem of violence is an un-American problem. It\nhas no partisan or philosophical element. Therefore, I urge you find ways\nas quickly as possible to set aside partisan differences and pass a strong,\nsmart, tough crime bill.But further, I urge you to consider this: As you demand tougher penalties\nfor those who choose violence, let us also remember how we came to this sad\npoint. In our toughest neighborhoods, on our meanest streets, in our\npoorest rural areas, we have seen a stunning and simultaneous breakdown of\ncommunity, family, and work, the heart and soul of civilized society. This\nhas created a vast vacuum which has been filled by violence and drugs and\ngangs. So I ask you to remember that even as we say no to crime, we must\ngive people, especially our young people something to say yes to. Many of\nour initiatives, from job training to welfare reform to health care to\nnational service will help to rebuild distressed communities, to strengthen\nfamilies, to provide work, but more needs to be done. That's what our\ncommunity empowerment agenda is all about--challenging businesses to\nprovide more investment through empowerment zones, ensuring banks will make\nloans in the same communities their deposits come from, passing legislation\nto unleash the power of capital through community development banks to\ncreate jobs, opportunity, and hope where they're needed most.But I think you know that to really solve this problem, we'll all have to\nput our heads together, leave our ideological armor aside, and find some\nnew ideas to do even more.The Role Of GovernmentAnd let's be honest, we all know something else, too. Our problems go way\nbeyond the reach of government. They're rooted in the loss of values and\nthe disappearance of work and the breakdown of our families and our\ncommunities. My fellow Americans, we can cut the deficit, create jobs,\npromote democracy around the world, pass welfare reform and health care,\npass the toughest crime bill in history and still leave too many of our\npeople behind.The American people have got to want to change from within if we're going\nto bring back work and family and community. We cannot renew our country\nwhen, within a decade, more than half of the children will be born into\nfamilies where there has been no marriage. We cannot renew this country\nwhen 13-year-old boys get semi-automatic weapons to shoot 9 year olds for\nkicks. We can't renew our country when children are having children and the\nfathers walk away as if the kids don't amount to anything. We can't renew\nthe country when our businesses eagerly look for new investments and new\ncustomers abroad but ignore those people right here at home who'd give\nanything to have their jobs and would gladly buy their products if they had\nthe money to do it.We can't renew our country unless more of us--I mean all of us--are\nwilling to join the churches and the other good citizens, people like all\nthe black ministers I've worked with over the years or the priests and the\nnuns I met at Our Lady of Help in East Los Angeles or my good friend Tony\nCampolo in Philadelphia, unless we're willing to work with people like\nthat, people who are saving kids, adopting schools, making streets safer.\nAll of us can do that.We can't renew our country until we realize that governments don't raise\nchildren; parents do. Parents who know their children's teachers and turn\noff the television and help with the homework and teach their kids right\nfrom wrong--those kind of parents can make all the difference. I know. I\nhad one. And I'm telling you we have got to stop pointing our fingers at\nthese kids who have no future and reach our hands out to them. Our country\nneeds it. We need it. And they deserve it.And so I say to you tonight let's give our children a future. Let us take\naway their guns and give them books. Let us overcome their despair and\nreplace it with hope. Let us, by our example, teach them to obey the law,\nrespect our neighbors, and cherish our values. Let us weave these sturdy\nthreads into a new American community that once more stand strong against\nthe forces of despair and evil because everybody has a chance to walk into\na better tomorrow.Oh, there will be naysayers who fear that we won't be equal to the\nchallenges of this time, but they misread our history, our heritage, even\ntoday's headlines. All those things tell us we can and we will overcome any\nchallenge.When the earth shook and fires raged in California; when I saw the\nMississippi deluge the farmlands of the Midwest in a 500 year flood; when\nthe century's bitterest cold swept from North Dakota to Newport News it\nseemed as though the world itself was coming apart at the seams. But the\nAmerican people, they just came together. They rose to the occasion,\nneighbor helping neighbor, strangers risking life and limb to stay total\nstrangers, showing the better angels of our nature.Let us not reserve the better angels only for natural disasters, leaving\nour deepest and most profound problems to petty political fighting.Let us instead by true to our spirit, facing facts, coming together,\nbringing hope and moving forward.Tonight, my fellow Americans, we are summoned to answer a question as old\nas the republic itself, what is the state of our union?It is growing stronger but it must be stronger still. With your help and\nGod's help it will be.Thank you and God Bless America.",
