    "speech": "Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow\nAmericans:Today in America, a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed\nit, and did her part to lift America's graduation rate to its highest\nlevel in more than three decades.An entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup, and did her\npart to add to the more than eight million new jobs our businesses have\ncreated over the past four years.An autoworker fine-tuned some of the best, most fuel-efficient cars in\nthe world, and did his part to help America wean itself off foreign oil.A farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five-year stretch\nof farm exports in our history.  A rural doctor gave a young child the\nfirst prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford.  A man\ntook the bus home from the graveyard shift, bone-tired but dreaming big\ndreams for his son.  And in tight-knit communities across America,\nfathers and mothers will tuck in their kids, put an arm around their\nspouse, remember fallen comrades, and give thanks for being home from a\nwar that, after twelve long years, is finally coming to an end.Tonight, this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent:\nit is you, our citizens, who make the state of our union strong.Here are the results of your efforts:  The lowest unemployment rate in\nover five years.  A rebounding housing market.  A manufacturing sector\nthat's adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s.  More oil\nproduced at home than we buy from the rest of the world  the first time\nthat's happened in nearly twenty years.  Our deficits  cut by more than\nhalf.  And for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around\nthe world have declared that China is no longer the world's number one\nplace to invest; America is.That's why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America.  After\nfive years of grit and determined effort, the United States is\nbetter-positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth.The question for everyone in this chamber, running through every\ndecision we make this year, is whether we are going to help or hinder\nthis progress.  For several years now, this town has been consumed by a\nrancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government.  It's\nan important debate  one that dates back to our very founding.  But\nwhen that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic\nfunctions of our democracy  when our differences shut down government\nor threaten the full faith and credit of the United States  then we are\nnot doing right by the American people.As President, I'm committed to making Washington work better, and\nrebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here.  I believe most of\nyou are, too.  Last month, thanks to the work of Democrats and\nRepublicans, this Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of\nlast year's severe cuts to priorities like education.  Nobody got\neverything they wanted, and we can still do more to invest in this\ncountry's future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way.  But\nthe budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new\njobs, not creating new crises.In the coming months, let's see where else we can make progress\ntogether.  Let's make this a year of action.  That's what most Americans\nwant  for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their\nhopes, their aspirations.  And what I believe unites the people of this\nnation, regardless of race or region or party, young or old, rich or\npoor, is the simple, profound belief in opportunity for all  the notion\nthat if you work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead.Let's face it: that belief has suffered some serious blows.  Over more\nthan three decades, even before the Great Recession hit, massive shifts\nin technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good,\nmiddle-class jobs, and weakened the economic foundations that families\ndepend on.Today, after four years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock\nprices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done\nbetter.  But average wages have barely budged.  Inequality has deepened.\n Upward mobility has stalled.  The cold, hard fact is that even in the\nmidst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to\nget by  let alone get ahead.  And too many still aren't working at all.Our job is to reverse these trends.  It won't happen right away, and we\nwon't agree on everything.  But what I offer tonight is a set of\nconcrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle\nclass, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class.  Some\nrequire Congressional action, and I'm eager to work with all of you. \nBut America does not stand still  and neither will I.  So wherever and\nwhenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for\nmore American families, that's what I'm going to do.As usual, our First Lady sets a good example.  Michelle's Let's Move\npartnership with schools, businesses, and local leaders has helped bring\ndown childhood obesity rates for the first time in thirty years  an\nachievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for\ndecades to come.  The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill\nBiden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly\n400,000 veterans and military spouses.  Taking a page from that\nplaybook, the White House just organized a College Opportunity Summit\nwhere already, 150 universities, businesses, and nonprofits have made\nconcrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education\n and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get\nto campus.  Across the country, we're partnering with mayors, governors,\nand state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality.The point is, there are millions of Americans outside Washington who\n are tired of stale political arguments, and are moving this country\n forward.  They believe, and I believe, that here in America, our\n success should depend not on accident of birth, but the strength of our\n work ethic and the scope of our dreams.  That's what drew our forebears\n here.  It's how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of America's\n largest automaker; how the son of a barkeeper is Speaker of the House;\n how the son of a single mom can be President of the greatest nation on\n Earth.Opportunity is who we are.  And the defining project of our generation\nis to restore that promise.We know where to start: the best measure of opportunity is access to a\ngood job.  With the economy picking up speed, companies say they intend\nto hire more people this year.  And over half of big manufacturers say\nthey're thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad.So let's make that decision easier for more companies.  Both Democrats\nand Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful,\ncomplicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here, and reward\ncompanies that keep profits abroad.  Let's flip that equation.  Let's\nwork together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship\njobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here\nat home.Moreover, we can take the money we save with this transition to tax\nreform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports,\nunclogging our commutes  because in today's global economy, first-class\njobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure.  We'll need Congress to\nprotect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and\nwaterways bills this summer.  But I will act on my own to slash\nbureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so\nwe can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible.We also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race\nfor the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs.  My administration\nhas launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in Raleigh and\nYoungstown, where we've connected businesses to research universities\nthat can help America lead the world in advanced technologies.  Tonight,\nI'm announcing we'll launch six more this year.  Bipartisan bills in\nboth houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they\ncreate.  So get those bills to my desk and put more Americans back to\nwork.Let's do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who\ncreate most new jobs in America.  Over the past five years, my\nadministration has made more loans to small business owners than any\nother.  And when ninety-eight percent of our exporters are small\nbusinesses, new trade partnerships with Europe and the Asia-Pacific will\nhelp them create more jobs.  We need to work together on tools like\nbipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers, protect our\nenvironment, and open new markets to new goods stamped \"Made in the\nUSA.\"  China and Europe aren't standing on the sidelines.  Neither\nshould we.We know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own\nthe global economy tomorrow.  This is an edge America cannot surrender. \nFederally-funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind\nGoogle and smartphones.  That's why Congress should undo the damage done\nby last year's cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great\nAmerican discovery  whether it's vaccines that stay ahead of\ndrug-resistant bacteria, or paper-thin material that's stronger than\nsteel.  And let's pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses\nto stay focused on innovation, not costly, needless litigation.Now, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our\ncommitment to American energy.  The all-of-the-above energy strategy I\nannounced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to\nenergy independence than we've been in decades.One of the reasons why is natural gas  if extracted safely, it's the\nbridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution\nthat causes climate change.  Businesses plan to invest almost $100\nbillion in new factories that use natural gas.  I'll cut red tape to\nhelp states get those factories built, and this Congress can help by\nputting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars\nand trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas.  My administration\nwill keep working with the industry to sustain production and job growth\nwhile strengthening protection of our air, our water, and our\ncommunities.  And while we're at it, I'll use my authority to protect\nmore of our pristine federal lands for future generations.It's not just oil and natural gas production that's booming; we're\nbecoming a global leader in solar, too.  Every four minutes, another\nAmerican home or business goes solar; every panel pounded into place by\na worker whose job can't be outsourced.  Let's continue that progress\nwith a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil\nfuel industries that don't need it, so that we can invest more in fuels\nof the future that do.And even as we've increased energy production, we've partnered with\nbusinesses, builders, and local communities to reduce the energy we\nconsume.  When we rescued our automakers, for example, we worked with\nthem to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars.  In the\ncoming months, I'll build on that success by setting new standards for\nour trucks, so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at\nthe pump.Taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a\ncleaner, safer planet.  Over the past eight years, the United States has\nreduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth. \nBut we have to act with more urgency  because a changing climate is\nalready harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal\ncities dealing with floods.  That's why I directed my administration to\nwork with states, utilities, and others to set new standards on the\namount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the\nair.  The shift to a cleaner energy economy won't happen overnight, and\nit will require tough choices along the way.  But the debate is settled.\n Climate change is a fact.  And when our children's children look us in\nthe eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more\nstable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say\nyes, we did.Finally, if we are serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the\ncall of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, and law\nenforcement  and fix our broken immigration system.  Republicans and\nDemocrats in the Senate have acted.  I know that members of both parties\nin the House want to do the same.  Independent economists say\nimmigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by\nalmost $1 trillion in the next two decades.  And for good reason: when\npeople come here to fulfill their dreams  to study, invent, and\ncontribute to our culture  they make our country a more attractive\nplace for businesses to locate and create jobs for everyone.  So let's\nget immigration reform done this year.The ideas I've outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs.\n But in this rapidly-changing economy, we have to make sure that every\nAmerican has the skills to fill those jobs.The good news is, we know how to do it.  Two years ago, as the auto\nindustry came roaring back, Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm in\nDetroit.  She knew that Ford needed parts for the best-selling truck in\nAmerica, and she knew how to make them.  She just needed the workforce. \nSo she dialed up what we call an American Job Center  places where\nfolks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new\njob, or better job.  She was flooded with new workers.  And today,\nDetroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees.What Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every\nemployer  and every job seeker.  So tonight, I've asked Vice President\nBiden to lead an across-the-board reform of America's training programs\nto make sure they have one mission: train Americans with the skills\nemployers need, and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right\nnow.  That means more on-the-job training, and more apprenticeships that\nset a young worker on an upward trajectory for life.  It means\nconnecting companies to community colleges that can help design training\nto fill their specific needs.  And if Congress wants to help, you can\nconcentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready-to-work\nAmericans with ready-to-be-filled jobs.I'm also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster\n by reforming unemployment insurance so that it's more effective in\n today's economy.  But first, this Congress needs to restore the\n unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people.Let me tell you why.Misty DeMars is a mother of two young boys. She'd been steadily employed\nsince she was a teenager.  She put herself through college.  She'd never\ncollected unemployment benefits.  In May, she and her husband used their\nlife savings to buy their first home.  A week later, budget cuts claimed\nthe job she loved.  Last month, when their unemployment insurance was\ncut off, she sat down and wrote me a letter  the kind I get every day. \n\"We are the face of the unemployment crisis,\" she wrote.  \"I am not\ndependent on the governmentOur country depends on people like us who\nbuild careers, contribute to societycare about our neighborsI am\nconfident that in time I will find a jobI will pay my taxes, and we\nwill raise our children in their own home in the community we love. \nPlease give us this chance.\"Congress, give these hardworking, responsible Americans that chance. \nThey need our help, but more important, this country needs them in the\ngame.  That's why I've been asking CEOs to give more long-term\nunemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support\ntheir families; this week, many will come to the White House to make\nthat commitment real.  Tonight, I ask every business leader in America\nto join us and to do the same  because we are stronger when America\nfields a full team.Of course, it's not enough to train today's workforce.  We also have to\n prepare tomorrow's workforce, by guaranteeing every child access to a\n world-class education.Estiven Rodriguez couldn't speak a word of English when he moved to New\nYork City at age nine.  But last month, thanks to the support of great\nteachers and an innovative tutoring program, he led a march of his\nclassmates  through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors  from\ntheir high school to the post office, where they mailed off their\ncollege applications.  And this son of a factory worker just found out\nhe's going to college this fall.Five years ago, we set out to change the odds for all our kids.  We\nworked with lenders to reform student loans, and today, more young\npeople are earning college degrees than ever before.  Race to the Top,\nwith the help of governors from both parties, has helped states raise\nexpectations and performance.  Teachers and principals in schools from\nTennessee to Washington, D.C. are making big strides in preparing\nstudents with skills for the new economy  problem solving, critical\nthinking, science, technology, engineering, and math.  Some of this\nchange is hard.  It requires everything from more challenging\ncurriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers\nand new ways to measure how well our kids think, not how well they can\nfill in a bubble on a test.  But it's worth it  and it's working.The problem is we're still not reaching enough kids, and we're not\nreaching them in time.  That has to change.Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child's\nlife is high-quality early education.  Last year, I asked this Congress\nto help states make high-quality pre-K available to every four year-old.\n As a parent as well as a President, I repeat that request tonight. But\nin the meantime, thirty states have raised pre-k funding on their own. \nThey know we can't wait.  So just as we worked with states to reform our\nschools, this year, we'll invest in new partnerships with states and\ncommunities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest\nchildren.  And as Congress decides what it's going to do, I'm going to\npull together a coalition of elected officials, business leaders, and\nphilanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-quality pre-K\nthey need.Last year, I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to\nhigh-speed broadband over the next four years.  Tonight, I can announce\nthat with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple, Microsoft,\nSprint, and Verizon, we've got a down payment to start connecting more\nthan 15,000 schools and twenty million students over the next two years,\nwithout adding a dime to the deficit.We're working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges\nand employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training\nthat can lead directly to a job and career.  We're shaking up our system\nof higher education to give parents more information, and colleges more\nincentives to offer better value, so that no middle-class kid is priced\nout of a college education.  We're offering millions the opportunity to\ncap their monthly student loan payments to ten percent of their income,\nand I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more\nAmericans who feel trapped by student loan debt.  And I'm reaching out\nto some of America's leading foundations and corporations on a new\ninitiative to help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on\ntrack and reach their full potential.The bottom line is, Michelle and I want every child to have the same\nchance this country gave us.  But we know our opportunity agenda won't\nbe complete  and too many young people entering the workforce today\nwill see the American Dream as an empty promise  unless we do more to\nmake sure our economy honors the dignity of work, and hard work pays off\nfor every single American.Today, women make up about half our workforce.  But they still make 77\ncents for every dollar a man earns.  That is wrong, and in 2014, it's an\nembarrassment. A woman deserves equal pay for equal work.  She deserves\nto have a baby without sacrificing her job.  A mother deserves a day off\nto care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship \nand you know what, a father does, too.  It's time to do away with\nworkplace policies that belong in a \"Mad Men\" episode.  This year, let's\nall come together  Congress, the White House, and businesses from Wall\nStreet to Main Street  to give every woman the opportunity she\ndeserves.  Because I firmly believe when women succeed, America\nsucceeds.Now, women hold a majority of lower-wage jobs  but they're not the only\nones stifled by stagnant wages.  Americans understand that some people\nwill earn more than others, and we don't resent those who, by virtue of\ntheir efforts, achieve incredible success.  But Americans overwhelmingly\nagree that no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family\nin poverty.In the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage, five\nstates have passed laws to raise theirs.  Many businesses have done it\non their own.  Nick Chute is here tonight with his boss, John Soranno. \nJohn's an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis, and Nick helps make the\ndough.  Only now he makes more of it: John just gave his employees a\nraise, to ten bucks an hour  a decision that eased their financial\nstress and boosted their morale.Tonight, I ask more of America's business leaders to follow John's lead\nand do what you can to raise your employees' wages.  To every mayor,\ngovernor, and state legislator in America, I say, you don't have to wait\nfor Congress to act; Americans will support you if you take this on. \nAnd as a chief executive, I intend to lead by example. Profitable\ncorporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost\nproductivity and reduce turnover. We should too.  In the coming weeks, I\nwill issue an Executive Order requiring federal contractors to pay their\nfederally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour \nbecause if you cook our troops' meals or wash their dishes, you\nshouldn't have to live in poverty.Of course, to reach millions more, Congress needs to get on board.\nToday, the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than\nit was when Ronald Reagan first stood here.  Tom Harkin and George\nMiller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $10.10. \nThis will help families.  It will give businesses customers with more\nmoney to spend.  It doesn't involve any new bureaucratic program.  So\njoin the rest of the country.  Say yes.  Give America a raise.There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and\nfew are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull\nthemselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit. \nRight now, it helps about half of all parents at some point.  But I\nagree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn't do enough for\nsingle workers who don't have kids.  So let's work together to\nstrengthen the credit, reward work, and help more Americans get ahead.Let's do more to help Americans save for retirement. Today, most workers\ndon't have a pension.  A Social Security check often isn't enough on its\nown.  And while the stock market has doubled over the last five years,\nthat doesn't help folks who don't have 401ks.  That's why, tomorrow, I\nwill direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to\nstart their own retirement savings: MyRA. It's a new savings bond that\nencourages folks to build a nest egg.  MyRA guarantees a decent return\nwith no risk of losing what you put in.  And if this Congress wants to\nhelp, work with me to fix an upside-down tax code that gives big tax\nbreaks to help the wealthy save, but does little to nothing for\nmiddle-class Americans.  Offer every American access to an automatic IRA\non the job, so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber\ncan.  And since the most important investment many families make is\ntheir home, send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the\nbill for a housing crisis ever again, and keeps the dream of\nhomeownership alive for future generations of Americans.One last point on financial security.  For decades, few things exposed\nhard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health\ncare system.  And in case you haven't heard, we're in the process of\nfixing that.A pre-existing condition used to mean that someone like Amanda Shelley,\na physician assistant and single mom from Arizona, couldn't get health\ninsurance.  But on January 1st, she got covered.  On January 3rd, she\nfelt a sharp pain.  On January 6th, she had emergency surgery.  Just one\nweek earlier, Amanda said, that surgery would've meant bankruptcy.That's what health insurance reform is all about  the peace of mind\nthat if misfortune strikes, you don't have to lose everything.Already, because of the Affordable Care Act, more than three million\nAmericans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents' plans.More than nine million Americans have signed up for private health\ninsurance or Medicaid coverage.And here's another number: zero.  Because of this law, no American can\never again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition\nlike asthma, back pain, or cancer. No woman can ever be charged more\njust because she's a woman.  And we did all this while adding years to\nMedicare's finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat, and lowering\nprescription costs for millions of seniors.Now, I don't expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of\nthis law.  But I know that the American people aren't interested in\nrefighting old battles.  So again, if you have specific plans to cut\ncosts, cover more people, and increase choice  tell America what you'd\ndo differently.  Let's see if the numbers add up.  But let's not have\nanother forty-something votes to repeal a law that's already helping\nmillions of Americans like Amanda.  The first forty were plenty.  We got\nit.  We all owe it to the American people to say what we're for, not\njust what we're against.And if you want to know the real impact this law is having, just talk to\nGovernor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who's here tonight.  Kentucky's not\nthe most liberal part of the country, but he's like a man possessed when\nit comes to covering his commonwealth's families.  \"They are our friends\nand neighbors,\" he said.  \"They are people we shop and go to church\nwithfarmers out on the tractorsgrocery clerksthey are people who go\nto work every morning praying they don't get sick.  No one deserves to\nlive that way.\"Steve's right.  That's why, tonight, I ask every American who knows\nsomeone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st.\n Moms, get on your kids to sign up.  Kids, call your mom and walk her\nthrough the application.  It will give her some peace of mind  plus,\nshe'll appreciate hearing from you.  After all, that's the spirit that\nhas always moved this nation forward.  It's the spirit of citizenship \nthe recognition that through hard work and responsibility, we can pursue\nour individual dreams, but still come together as one American family to\nmake sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well. Citizenship\nmeans standing up for everyone's right to vote.  Last year, part of the\nVoting Rights Act was weakened.  But conservative Republicans and\nliberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it; and the\nbipartisan commission I appointed last year has offered reforms so that\nno one has to wait more than a half hour to vote.  Let's support these\nefforts.  It should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank\naccount, that drives our democracy. Citizenship means standing up for\nthe lives that gun violence steals from us each day.  I have seen the\ncourage of parents, students, pastors, and police officers all over this\ncountry who say \"we are not afraid,\" and I intend to keep trying, with\nor without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent\nAmericans in our movie theaters, shopping malls, or schools like Sandy\nHook. Citizenship demands a sense of common cause; participation in the\nhard work of self-government; an obligation to serve to our communities.\n And I know this chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their\ncountry than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States\nArmed Forces. Tonight, because of the extraordinary troops and civilians\nwho risk and lay down their lives to keep us free, the United States is\nmore secure.  When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving\nin Iraq and Afghanistan.  Today, all our troops are out of Iraq.  More\nthan 60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan.  With\nAfghan forces now in the lead for their own security, our troops have\nmoved to a support role. Together with our allies, we will complete our\nmission there by the end of this year, and America's longest war will\nfinally be over. After 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it\ntakes responsibility for its own future.  If the Afghan government signs\na security agreement that we have negotiated, a small force of Americans\ncould remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow\nmissions: training and assisting Afghan forces, and counterterrorism\noperations to pursue any remnants of al Qaeda.  For while our\nrelationship with Afghanistan will change, one thing will not: our\nresolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country. The\nfact is, that danger remains.  While we have put al Qaeda's core\nleadership on a path to defeat, the threat has evolved, as al Qaeda\naffiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the\nworld. In Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, and Mali, we have to keep working with\npartners to disrupt and disable these networks. In Syria, we'll support\nthe opposition that rejects  the agenda of terrorist networks. Here at\nhome, we'll keep strengthening our defenses, and combat new threats like\ncyberattacks.  And as we reform our defense budget, we have to keep\nfaith with our men and women in uniform, and invest in the capabilities\nthey need to succeed in future missions. We have to remain vigilant. \nBut I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on\nour military alone. As Commander-in-Chief, I have used force when needed\nto protect the American people, and I will never hesitate to do so as\nlong as I hold this office.  But I will not send our troops into harm's\nway unless it's truly necessary; nor will I allow our sons and daughters\nto be mired in open-ended conflicts.  We must fight the battles that\nneed to be fought, not those that terrorists prefer from us \nlarge-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed\nextremism. So, even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks \nthrough more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our\nforeign partners  America must move off a permanent war footing. \nThat's why I've imposed prudent limits on the use of drones  for we\nwill not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their\ncountries without regard for the consequence.  That's why, working with\nthis Congress, I will reform our surveillance programs  because the\nvital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence,\nhere and abroad, that the privacy of ordinary people is not being\nviolated.  And with the Afghan war ending, this needs to be the year\nCongress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we\nclose the prison at Guantanamo Bay  because we counter terrorism not\njust through intelligence and military action, but by remaining true to\nour Constitutional ideals, and setting an example for the rest of the\nworld. You see, in a world of complex threats, our security and\nleadership depends on all elements of our power  including strong and\nprincipled diplomacy.  American diplomacy has rallied more than fifty\ncountries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong\nhands, and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on Cold War stockpiles.\n American diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria's\nchemical weapons are being eliminated, and we will continue to work with\nthe international community to usher in the future the Syrian people\ndeserve  a future free of dictatorship, terror and fear. As we speak,\nAmerican diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they\nengage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there; to\nachieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians, and lasting\npeace and security for the State of Israel  a Jewish state that knows\nAmerica will always be at their side. And it is American diplomacy,\nbacked by pressure, that has halted the progress of Iran's nuclear\nprogram  and rolled parts of that program back  for the very first\ntime in a decade.  As we gather here tonight, Iran has begun to\neliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium.  It is not\ninstalling advanced centrifuges.  Unprecedented inspections help the\nworld verify, every day, that Iran is not building a bomb.  And with our\nallies and partners, we're engaged in negotiations to see if we can\npeacefully achieve a goal we all share: preventing Iran from obtaining a\nnuclear weapon. These negotiations will be difficult.  They may not\nsucceed.  We are clear-eyed about Iran's support for terrorist\norganizations like Hezbollah, which threaten our allies; and the\nmistrust between our nations cannot be wished away.  But these\nnegotiations do not rely on trust; any long-term deal we agree to must\nbe based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international\ncommunity that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb.  If John F. Kennedy\nand Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union, then surely a\nstrong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful\nadversaries today. The sanctions that we put in place helped make this\nopportunity possible.  But let me be clear: if this Congress sends me a\nnew sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto\nit.  For the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a\nchance to succeed.  If Iran's leaders do not seize this opportunity,\nthen I will be the first to call for more sanctions, and stand ready to\nexercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon. \nBut if Iran's leaders do seize the chance, then Iran could take an\nimportant step to rejoin the community of nations, and we will have\nresolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the\nrisks of war. Finally, let's remember that our leadership is defined not\njust by our defense against threats, but by the enormous opportunities\nto do good and promote understanding around the globe  to forge greater\ncooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want. \nAnd no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities\nthan America.  Our alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world\nhas ever known.  From Tunisia to Burma, we're supporting those who are\nwilling to do the hard work of building democracy.  In Ukraine, we stand\nfor the principle that all people have the right to express themselves\nfreely and peacefully, and have a say in their country's future.  Across\nAfrica, we're bringing together businesses and governments to double\naccess to electricity and help end extreme poverty.  In the Americas, we\nare building new ties of commerce, but we're also expanding cultural and\neducational exchanges among young people.  And we will continue to focus\non the Asia-Pacific, where we support our allies, shape a future of\ngreater security and prosperity, and extend a hand to those devastated\nby disaster  as we did in the Philippines, when our Marines and\ncivilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and were greeted\nwith words like, \"We will never forget your kindness\" and \"God bless\nAmerica!\" We do these things because they help promote our long-term\nsecurity.  And we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and\nequality of every human being, regardless of race or religion, creed or\nsexual orientation.  And next week, the world will see one expression of\nthat commitment  when Team USA marches the red, white, and blue into\nthe Olympic Stadium  and brings home the gold. My fellow Americans, no\nother country in the world does what we do.  On every issue, the world\nturns to us, not simply because of the size of our economy or our\nmilitary might  but because of the ideals we stand for, and the burdens\nwe bear to advance them. No one knows this better than those who serve\nin uniform.  As this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of\nheroes returns to civilian life.  We'll keep slashing that backlog so\nour veterans receive the benefits they've earned, and our wounded\nwarriors receive the health care  including the mental health care \nthat they need.  We'll keep working to help all our veterans translate\ntheir skills and leadership into jobs here at home.  And we all continue\nto join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families.\nLet me tell you about one of those families I've come to know. I first\nmet Cory Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha Beach on the 65th\nanniversary of D-Day.  Along with some of his fellow Rangers, he walked\nme through the program  a strong, impressive young man, with an easy\nmanner, sharp as a tack.  We joked around, and took pictures, and I told\nhim to stay in touch. A few months later, on his tenth deployment, Cory\nwas nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan. His\ncomrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his\nbrain.  For months, he lay in a coma.  The next time I met him, in the\nhospital, he couldn't speak; he could barely move.  Over the years, he's\nendured dozens of surgeries and procedures, and hours of grueling rehab\nevery day.  Even now, Cory is still blind in one eye.  He still\nstruggles on his left side.  But slowly, steadily, with the support of\ncaregivers like his dad Craig, and the community around him, Cory has\ngrown stronger. Day by day, he's learned to speak again and stand again\nand walk again  and he's working toward the day when he can serve his\ncountry again.  \"My recovery has not been easy,\" he says. \"Nothing in\nlife that's worth anything is easy.\"  Cory is here tonight.  And like\nthe Army he loves, like the America he serves, Sergeant First Class Cory\nRemsburg never gives up, and he does not quit.  My fellow Americans, men\nand women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy.  Our\nfreedom, our democracy, has never been easy.  Sometimes we stumble; we\nmake mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged.  But for more than two\nhundred years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective\nshoulder to the wheel of progress  to create and build and expand the\npossibilities of individual achievement; to free other nations from\ntyranny and fear; to promote justice, and fairness, and equality under\nthe law, so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real\nfor every citizen.  The America we want for our kids  a rising America\nwhere honest work is plentiful and communities are strong; where\nprosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as\nour dreams and toil will take us  none of it is easy.  But if we work\ntogether; if we summon what is best in us, with our feet planted firmly\nin today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow  I know it's within our\nreach.  Believe it. God bless you, and God bless the United States of\nAmerica.",
