    "date": "December 6, 1897", 
    "speech": "To the Senate and House of Representatives:It gives me pleasure to extend greeting to the Fifty-fifth Congress,\nassembled in regular session at the seat of Government, with many of whose\nSenators and Representatives I have been associated in the legislative\nservice. Their meeting occurs under felicitous conditions, justifying\nsincere congratulation and calling for our grateful acknowledgment to a\nbeneficent Providence which has so signally blessed and prospered us as a\nnation. Peace and good will with all the nations of the earth continue\nunbroken.A matter of genuine satisfaction is the growing feeling of fraternal regard\nand unification of all sections of our country, the incompleteness of which\nhas too long delayed realization of the highest blessings of the Union. The\nspirit of patriotism is universal and is ever increasing in fervor. The\npublic questions which now most engross us are lifted far above either\npartisanship, prejudice, or former sectional differences. They affect every\npart of our common country alike and permit of no division on ancient\nlines. Questions of foreign policy, of revenue, the soundness of the\ncurrency, the inviolability of national obligations, the improvement of the\npublic service, appeal to the individual conscience of every earnest\ncitizen to whatever party he belongs or in whatever section of the country\nhe may reside.The extra session of this Congress which closed during July last enacted\nimportant legislation, and while its full effect has not yet been realized,\nwhat it has already accomplished assures us of its timeliness and wisdom.\nTo test its permanent value further time will be required, and the people,\nsatisfied with its operation and results thus far, are in no mind to\nwithhold from it a fair trial.Tariff legislation having been settled by the extra session of Congress,\nthe question next pressing for consideration is that of the currency.The work of putting our finances upon a sound basis, difficult as it may\nseem, will appear easier when we recall the financial operations of the\nGovernment since 1866. On the 30th day of June of that year we had\noutstanding demand liabilities in the sum of $728,868,447.41. On the 1st of\nJanuary, 1879, these liabilities had been reduced to $443,889,495.88. Of our\ninterest-bearing obligations, the figures are even more striking. On July\n1, 1866, the principal of the interest-bearing debt of the Government was\n$2,332,331,208. On the 1st day of July, 1893, this sum had been reduced to\n$585,137,100, or an aggregate reduction of $1,747,294,108. The\ninterest-bearing debt of the United States on the 1st day of December,\n1897, was $847,365,620. The Government money now outstanding (December 1)\nconsists of $346,681,016 of United States notes, $107,793,280 of Treasury\nnotes issued by authority of the law of 1890, $384,963,504 of silver\ncertificates, and $61,280,761 of standard silver dollars.With the great resources of the Government, and with the honorable example\nof the past before us, we ought not to hesitate to enter upon a currency\nrevision which will make our demand obligations less onerous to the\nGovernment and relieve our financial laws from ambiguity and doubt.The brief review of what was accomplished from the close of the war to\n1893, makes unreasonable and groundless any distrust either of our\nfinancial ability or soundness; while the situation from 1893 to 1897 must\nadmonish Congress of the immediate necessity of so legislating as to make\nthe return of the conditions then prevailing impossible.There are many plans proposed as a remedy for the evil. Before we can find\nthe true remedy we must appreciate the real evil. It is not that our\ncurrency of every kind is not good, for every dollar of it is good; good\nbecause the Government's pledge is out to keep it so, and that pledge will\nnot be broken. However, the guaranty of our purpose to keep the pledge will\nbe best shown by advancing toward its fulfillment.The evil of the present system is found in the great cost to the Government\nof maintaining the parity of our different forms of money, that is, keeping\nall of them at par with gold. We surely cannot be longer heedless of the\nburden this imposes upon the people, even under fairly prosperous\nconditions, while the past four years have demonstrated that it is not only\nan expensive charge upon the Government, but a dangerous menace to the\nNational credit.It is manifest that we must devise some plan to protect the Government\nagainst bond issues for repeated redemptions. We must either curtail the\nopportunity for speculation, made easy by the multiplied redemptions of our\ndemand obligations, or increase the gold reserve for their redemption. We\nhave $900,000,000 of currency which the Government by solemn enactment has\nundertaken to keep at par with gold. Nobody is obliged to redeem in gold\nbut the Government. The banks are not required to redeem in gold. The\nGovernment is obliged to keep equal with gold all its outstanding currency\nand coin obligations, while its receipts are not required to be paid in\ngold. They are paid in every kind of money but gold, and the only means by\nwhich the Government can with certainty get gold is by borrowing. It can\nget it in no other way when it most needs it. The Government without any\nfixed gold revenue is pledged to maintain gold redemption, which it has\nsteadily and faithfully done, and which, under the authority now given, it\nwill continue to do.The law which requires the Government, after having redeemed its United\nStates notes, to pay them out again as current funds, demands a constant\nreplenishment of the gold reserve. This is especially so in times of\nbusiness panic and when the revenues are insufficient to meet the expenses\nof the Government. At such times the Government has no other way to supply\nits deficit and maintain redemption but through the increase of its bonded\ndebt, as during the Administration of my predecessor, when $262,315,400 of\nfour-and-a-half per cent bonds were issued and sold and the proceeds used\nto pay the expenses of the Government in excess of the revenues and sustain\nthe gold reserve. While it is true that the greater part of the proceeds of\nthese bonds were used to supply deficient revenues, a considerable portion\nwas required to maintain the gold reserve.With our revenues equal to our expenses, there would be no deficit\nrequiring the issuance of bonds. But if the gold reserve falls below\n$100,000,000, how will it be replenished except by selling more bonds? Is\nthere any other way practicable under existing law? The serious question\nthen is, Shall we continue the policy that has been pursued in the past;\nthat is, when the gold reserve reaches the point of danger, issue more\nbonds and supply the needed gold, or shall we provide other means to\nprevent these recurring drains upon the gold reserve? If no further\nlegislation is had and the policy of selling bonds is to be continued, then\nCongress should give the Secretary of the Treasury authority to sell bonds\nat long or short periods, bearing a less rate of interest than is now\nauthorized by law.I earnestly recommend, as soon as the receipts of the Government are quite\nsufficient to pay all the expenses of the Government, that when any of the\nUnited States notes are presented for redemption in gold and are redeemed\nin gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart, and only paid out in\nexchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder of the United\nStates note prefers the gold and gets it from the Government, he should not\nreceive back from the Government a United States note without paying gold\nin exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the more apparent when\nthe Government issues an interest-bearing debt to provide gold for the\nredemption of United States notes--a non-interest-bearing debt. Surely it\nshould not pay them out again except on demand and for gold. If they are\nput out in any other way, they may return again to be followed by another\nbond issue to redeem them--another interest-bearing debt to redeem a\nnon-interest-bearing debt.In my view, it is of the utmost importance that the Government should be\nrelieved from the burden of providing all the gold required for exchanges\nand export. This responsibility is alone borne by the Government, without\nany of the usual and necessary banking powers to help itself. The banks do\nnot feel the strain of gold redemption. The whole strain rests upon the\nGovernment, and the size of the gold reserve in the Treasury has come to\nbe, with or without reason, the signal of danger or of security. This ought\nto be stopped.If we are to have an era of prosperity in the country, with sufficient\nreceipts for the expenses of the Government, we may feel no immediate\nembarrassment from our present currency; but the danger still exists, and\nwill be ever present, menacing us so long as the existing system continues.\nAnd, besides, it is in times of adequate revenues and business tranquillity\nthat the Government should prepare for the worst. We cannot avoid, without\nserious consequences, the wise consideration and prompt solution of this\nquestion.The Secretary of the Treasury has outlined a plan, in great detail, for the\npurpose of removing the threatened recurrence of a depleted gold reserve\nand save us from future embarrassment on that account. To this plan I\ninvite your careful consideration.I concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in his recommendation that\nNational banks be allowed to issue notes to the face value of the bonds\nwhich they have deposited for circulation, and that the tax on circulating\nnotes secured by deposit of such bonds be reduced to one-half of one per\ncent per annum. I also join him in recommending that authority be given for\nthe establishment of National banks with a minimum capital of $25,000. This\nwill enable the smaller villages and agricultural regions of the country to\nbe supplied with currency to meet their needs.I recommend that the issue of National bank notes be restricted to the\ndenomination of ten dollars and upwards. If the suggestions I have herein\nmade shall have the approval of Congress, then I would recommend that\nNational banks be required to redeem their notes in gold.The most important problem with which this Government is now called upon to\ndeal pertaining to its foreign relations concerns its duty toward Spain and\nthe Cuban insurrection. Problems and conditions more or less in common with\nthose now existing have confronted this Government at various times in the\npast. The story of Cuba for many years has been one of unrest, growing\ndiscontent, an effort toward a larger enjoyment of liberty and\nself-control, of organized resistance to the mother country, of depression\nafter distress and warfare, and of ineffectual settlement to be followed by\nrenewed revolt. For no enduring period since the enfranchisement of the\ncontinental possessions of Spain in the Western Continent has the condition\nof Cuba or the policy of Spain toward Cuba not caused concern to the United\nStates.The prospect from time to time that the weakness of Spain's hold upon the\nisland and the political vicissitudes and embarrassments of the home\nGovernment might lead to the transfer of Cuba to a continental power called\nforth between 1823 and 1860 various emphatic declarations of the policy of\nthe United States to permit no disturbance of Cuba's connection with Spain\nunless in the direction of independence or acquisition by us through\npurchase, nor has there been any change of this declared policy since upon\nthe part of the Government.The revolution which began in 1868 lasted for ten years despite the\nstrenuous efforts of the successive peninsular governments to suppress it.\nThen as now the Government of the United States testified its grave concern\nand offered its aid to put an end to bloodshed in Cuba. The overtures made\nby General Grant were refused and the war dragged on, entailing great loss\nof life and treasure and increased injury to American interests, besides\nthrowing enhanced burdens of neutrality upon this Government. In 1878 peace\nwas brought about by the truce of Zanjon, obtained by negotiations between\nthe Spanish commander, Martinez de Campos, and the insurgent leaders.The present insurrection broke out in February, 1895. It is not my purpose\nat this time to recall its remarkable increase or to characterize its\ntenacious resistance against the enormous forces massed against it by\nSpain. The revolt and the efforts to subdue it carried destruction to every\nquarter of the island, developing wide proportions and defying the efforts\nof Spain for its suppression. The civilized code of war has been\ndisregarded, no less so by the Spaniards than by the Cubans.The existing conditions can not but fill this Government and the American\npeople with the gravest apprehension. There is no desire on the part of our\npeople to profit by the misfortunes of Spain. We have only the desire to\nsee the Cubans prosperous and contented, enjoying that measure of\nself-control which is the inalienable right of man, protected in their\nright to reap the benefit of the exhaustless treasures of their country.The offer made by my predecessor in April, 1896, tendering the friendly\noffices of this Government, failed. Any mediation on our part was not\naccepted. In brief, the answer read: \"There is no effectual way to pacify\nCuba unless it begins with the actual submission of the rebels to the\nmother country.\" Then only could Spain act in the promised direction, of\nher own motion and after her own plans.The cruel policy of concentration was initiated February 16, 1896. The\nproductive districts controlled by the Spanish armies were depopulated. The\nagricultural inhabitants were herded in and about the garrison towns, their\nlands laid waste and their dwellings destroyed. This policy the late\ncabinet of Spain justified as a necessary measure of war and as a means of\ncutting off supplies from the insurgents. It has utterly failed as a war\nmeasure. It was not civilized warfare. It was extermination.Against this abuse of the rights of war I have felt constrained on repeated\noccasions to enter the firm and earnest protest of this Government. There\nwas much of public condemnation of the treatment of American citizens by\nalleged illegal arrests and long imprisonment awaiting trial or pending\nprotracted judicial proceedings. I felt it my first duty to make instant\ndemand for the release or speedy trial of all American citizens under\narrest. Before the change of the Spanish cabinet in October last twenty-two\nprisoners, citizens of the United States, had been given their freedom.For the relief of our own citizens suffering because of the conflict the\naid of Congress was sought in a special message, and under the\nappropriation of May 24, 1897, effective aid has been given to American\ncitizens in Cuba, many of them at their own request having been returned to\nthe United States.The instructions given to our new minister to Spain before his departure\nfor his post directed him to impress upon that Government the sincere wish\nof the United States to lend its aid toward the ending of the war in Cuba\nby reaching a peaceful and lasting result, just and honorable alike to\nSpain and to the Cuban people. These instructions recited the character and\nduration of the contest, the widespread losses it entails, the burdens and\nrestraints it imposes upon us, with constant disturbance of national\ninterests, and the injury resulting from an indefinite continuance of this\nstate of things. It was stated that at this juncture our Government was\nconstrained to seriously inquire if the time was not ripe when Spain of her\nown volition, moved by her own interests and every sentiment of humanity,\nshould put a stop to this destructive war and make proposals of settlement\nhonorable to herself and just to her Cuban colony. It was urged that as a\nneighboring nation, with large interests in Cuba, we could be required to\nwait only a reasonable time for the mother country to establish its\nauthority and restore peace and order within the borders of the island;\nthat we could not contemplate an indefinite period for the accomplishment\nof this result.No solution was proposed to which the slightest idea of humiliation to\nSpain could attach, and, indeed, precise proposals were withheld to avoid\nembarrassment to that Government. All that was asked or expected was that\nsome safe way might be speedily provided and permanent peace restored. It\nso chanced that the consideration of this offer, addressed to the same\nSpanish administration which had declined the tenders of my predecessor,\nand which for more than two years had poured men and treasure into Cuba in\nthe fruitless effort to suppress the revolt, fell to others. Between the\ndeparture of General Woodford, the new envoy, and his arrival in Spain the\nstatesman who had shaped the policy of his country fell by the hand of an\nassassin, and although the cabinet of the late premier still held office\nand received from our envoy the proposals he bore, that cabinet gave place\nwithin a few days thereafter to a new administration, under the leadership\nof Sagasta.The reply to our note was received on the 23d day of October. It is in the\ndirection of a better understanding. It appreciates the friendly purposes\nof this Government. It admits that our country is deeply affected by the\nwar in Cuba and that its desires for peace are just. It declares that the\npresent Spanish government is bound by every consideration to a change of\npolicy that should satisfy the United States and pacify Cuba within a\nreasonable time. To this end Spain has decided to put into effect the\npolitical reforms heretofore advocated by the present premier, without\nhalting for any consideration in the path which in its judgment leads to\npeace. The military operations, it is said, will continue, but will be\nhumane and conducted with all regard for private rights, being accompanied\nby political action leading to the autonomy of Cuba while guarding Spanish\nsovereignty. This, it is claimed, will result in investing Cuba with a\ndistinct personality, the island to be governed by an executive and by a\nlocal council or chamber, reserving to Spain the control of the foreign\nrelations, the army and navy, and the judicial administration. To\naccomplish this the present government proposes to modify existing\nlegislation by decree, leaving the Spanish Cortes, with the aid of Cuban\nsenators and deputies, to solve the economic problem and properly\ndistribute the existing debt.In the absence of a declaration of the measures that this Government\nproposes to take in carrying out its proffer of good offices, it suggests\nthat Spain be left free to conduct military operations and grant political\nreforms, while the United States for its part shall enforce its neutral\nobligations and cut off the assistance which it is asserted the insurgents\nreceive from this country. The supposition of an indefinite prolongation of\nthe war is denied. It is asserted that the western provinces are already\nwell-nigh reclaimed, that the planting of cane and tobacco therein has been\nresumed, and that by force of arms and new and ample reforms very early and\ncomplete pacification is hoped for.The immediate amelioration of existing conditions under the new\nadministration of Cuban affairs is predicted, and therewithal the\ndisturbance and all occasion for any change of attitude on the part of the\nUnited States. Discussion of the question of the international duties and\nresponsibilities of the United States as Spain understands them is\npresented, with an apparent disposition to charge us with failure in this\nregard. This charge is without any basis in fact. It could not have been\nmade if Spain had been cognizant of the constant efforts this Government\nhas made, at the cost of millions and by the employment of the\nadministrative machinery of the nation at command, to perform its full duty\naccording to the law of nations. That it has successfully prevented the\ndeparture of a single military expedition or armed vessel from our shores\nin violation of our laws would seem to be a sufficient answer. But of this\naspect of the Spanish note it is not necessary to speak further now. Firm\nin the conviction of a wholly performed obligation, due response to this\ncharge has been made in diplomatic course.Throughout all these horrors and dangers to our own peace this Government\nhas never in any way abrogated its sovereign prerogative of reserving to\nitself the determination of its policy and course according to its own high\nsense of right and in consonance with the dearest interests and convictions\nof our own people should the prolongation of the strife so demand.Of the untried measures there remain only: Recognition of the insurgents as\nbelligerents; recognition of the independence of Cuba; neutral intervention\nto end the war by imposing a rational compromise between the contestants,\nand intervention in favor of one or the other party. I speak not of\nforcible annexation, for that can not be thought of. That, by our code of\nmorality, would be criminal aggression.Recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents has often been\ncanvassed as a possible, if not inevitable, step both in regard to the\nprevious ten years' struggle and during the present war. I am not unmindful\nthat the two Houses of Congress in the spring of 1896 expressed the opinion\nby concurrent resolution that a condition of public war existed requiring\nor justifying the recognition of a state of belligerency in Cuba, and\nduring the extra session the Senate voted a joint resolution of like\nimport, which, however, was not brought to a vote in the House of\nRepresentatives. In the presence of these significant expressions of the\nsentiment of the legislative branch it behooves the Executive to soberly\nconsider the conditions under which so important a measure must needs rest\nfor justification. It is to be seriously considered whether the Cuban\ninsurrection possesses beyond dispute the attributes of statehood, which\nalone can demand the recognition of belligerency in its favor. Possession,\nin short, of the essential qualifications of sovereignty by the insurgents\nand the conduct of the war by them according to the received code of war\nare no less important factors toward the determination of the problem of\nbelligerency than are the influences and consequences of the struggle upon\nthe internal polity of the recognizing state.The wise utterances of President Grant in his memorable message of December\n7, 1875, are signally relevant to the present situation in Cuba, and it may\nbe wholesome now to recall them. At that time a ruinous conflict had for\nseven years wasted the neighboring island. During all those years an utter\ndisregard of the laws of civilized warfare and of the just demands of\nhumanity, which called forth expressions of condemnation from the nations\nof Christendom, continued unabated. Desolation and ruin pervaded that\nproductive region, enormously affecting the commerce of all commercial\nnations, but that of the United States more than any other by reason of\nproximity and larger trade and intercourse. At that juncture General Grant\nuttered these words, which now, as then, sum up the elements of the\nproblem: A recognition of the independence of Cuba being, in my opinion,\nimpracticable and indefensible, the question which next presents itself is\nthat of the recognition of belligerent rights in the parties to the\ncontest.In a former message to Congress I had occasion to consider this question,\nand reached the conclusion that the conflict in Cuba, dreadful and\ndevastating as were its incidents, did not rise to the fearful dignity of\nwar. It is possible that the acts of foreign powers, and even acts of Spain\nherself, of this very nature, might be pointed to in defense of such\nrecognition. But now, as in its past history, the United States should\ncarefully avoid the false lights which might lead it into the mazes of\ndoubtful law and of questionable propriety, and adhere rigidly and sternly\nto the rule, which has been its guide, of doing only that which is right\nand honest and of good report. The question of according or of withholding\nrights of belligerency must be judged in every case in view of the\nparticular attending facts. Unless justified by necessity, it is always,\nand justly, regarded as an unfriendly act and a gratuitous demonstration of\nmoral support to the rebellion. It is necessary, and it is required, when\nthe interests and rights of another government or of its people are so far\naffected by a pending civil conflict as to require a definition of its\nrelations to the parties thereto. But this conflict must be one which will\nbe recognized in the sense of international law as war. Belligerence, too,\nis a fact. The mere existence of contending armed bodies and their\noccasional conflicts do not constitute war in the sense referred to.\nApplying to the existing condition of affairs in Cuba the tests recognized\nby publicists and writers on international law, and which have been\nobserved by nations of dignity, honesty, and power when free from sensitive\nor selfish and unworthy motives, I fail to find in the insurrection the\nexistence of such a substantial political organization, real, palpable, and\nmanifest to the world, having the forms and capable of the ordinary\nfunctions of government toward its own people and to other states, with\ncourts for the administration of justice, with a local habitation,\npossessing such organization of force, such material, such occupation of\nterritory, as to take the contest out of the category of a mere rebellious\ninsurrection or occasional skirmishes and place it on the terrible footing\nof war, to which a recognition of belligerency would aim to elevate it. The\ncontest, moreover, is solely on land; the insurrection has not possessed\nitself of a single seaport whence it may send forth its flag, nor has it\nany means of communication with foreign powers except through the military\nlines of its adversaries. No apprehension of any of those sudden and\ndifficult complications which a war upon the ocean is apt to precipitate\nupon the vessels, both commercial and national, and upon the consular\nofficers of other powers calls for the definition of their relations to the\nparties to the contest. Considered as a question of expediency, I regard\nthe accordance of belligerent rights still to be as unwise and premature as\nI regard it to be, at present, indefensible as a measure of right. Such\nrecognition entails upon the country according the rights which flow from\nit difficult and complicated duties, and requires the exaction from the\ncontending parties of the strict observance of their rights and\nobligations. It confers the right of search upon the high seas by vessels\nof both parties; it would subject the carrying of arms and munitions of\nwar, which now may be transported freely and without interruption in the\nvessels of the United States, to detention and to possible seizure; it\nwould give rise to countless vexatious questions, would release the parent\nGovernment from responsibility for acts done by the insurgents, and would\ninvest Spain with the right to exercise the supervision recognized by our\ntreaty of 1795 over our commerce on the high seas, a very large part of\nwhich, in its traffic between the Atlantic and the Gulf States and between\nall of them and the States on the Pacific, passes through the waters which\nwash the shores of Cuba. The exercise of this supervision could scarce fail\nto lead, if not to abuses, certainly to collisions perilous to the peaceful\nrelations of the two States. There can be little doubt to what result such\nsupervision would before long draw this nation. It would be unworthy of the\nUnited States to inaugurate the possibilities of such result by measures of\nquestionable right or expediency or by any indirection. Turning to the\npractical aspects of a recognition of belligerency and reviewing its\ninconveniences and positive dangers, still further pertinent considerations\nappear. In the code of nations there is no such thing as a naked\nrecognition of belligerency, unaccompanied by the assumption of\ninternational neutrality. Such recognition, without more, will not confer\nupon either party to a domestic conflict a status not theretofore actually\npossessed or affect the relation of either party to other states. The act\nof recognition usually takes the form of a solemn proclamation of\nneutrality, which recites the de facto condition of belligerency as its\nmotive. It announces a domestic law of neutrality in the declaring state.\nIt assumes the international obligations of a neutral in the presence of a\npublic state of war. It warns all citizens and others within the\njurisdiction of the proclaimant that they violate those rigorous\nobligations at their own peril and can not expect to be shielded from the\nconsequences. The right of visit and search on the seas and seizure of\nvessels and cargoes and contraband of war and good prize under admiralty\nlaw must under international law be admitted as a legitimate consequence of\na proclamation of belligerency. While according the equal belligerent\nrights defined by public law to each party in our ports disfavors would be\nimposed on both, which, while nominally equal, would weigh heavily in\nbehalf of Spain herself. Possessing a navy and controlling the ports of\nCuba, her maritime rights could be asserted not only for the military\ninvestment of the island, but up to the margin of our own territorial\nwaters, and a condition of things would exist for which the Cubans within\ntheir own domain could not hope to create a parallel, while its creation\nthrough aid or sympathy from within our domain would be even more\nimpossible than now, with the additional obligations of international\nneutrality we would perforce assume.The enforcement of this enlarged and onerous code of neutrality would only\nbe influential within our own jurisdiction by land and sea and applicable\nby our own instrumentalities. It could impart to the United States no\njurisdiction between Spain and the insurgents. It would give the United\nStates no right of intervention to enforce the conduct of the strife within\nthe paramount authority of Spain according to the international code of\nwar.For these reasons I regard the recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban\ninsurgents as now unwise, and therefore inadmissible. Should that step\nhereafter be deemed wise as a measure of right and duty, the Executive will\ntake it.Intervention upon humanitarian grounds has been frequently suggested and\nhas not failed to receive my most anxious and earnest consideration. But\nshould such a step be now taken, when it is apparent that a hopeful change\nhas supervened in the policy of Spain toward Cuba? A new government has\ntaken office in the mother country. It is pledged in advance to the\ndeclaration that all the effort in the world can not suffice to maintain\npeace in Cuba by the bayonet; that vague promises of reform after\nsubjugation afford no solution of the insular problem; that with a\nsubstitution of commanders must come a change of the past system of warfare\nfor one in harmony with a new policy, which shall no longer aim to drive\nthe Cubans to the \"horrible alternative of taking to the thicket or\nsuccumbing in misery;\" that reforms must be instituted in accordance with\nthe needs and circumstances of the time, and that these reforms, while\ndesigned to give full autonomy to the colony and to create a virtual entity\nand self-controlled administration, shall yet conserve and affirm the\nsovereignty of Spain by a just distribution of powers and burdens upon a\nbasis of mutual interest untainted by methods of selfish expediency.The first acts of the new government lie in these honorable paths. The\npolicy of cruel rapine and extermination that so long shocked the universal\nsentiment of humanity has been reversed. Under the new military commander a\nbroad clemency is proffered. Measures have already been set on foot to\nrelieve the horrors of starvation. The power of the Spanish armies, it is\nasserted, is to be used not to spread ruin and desolation, but to protect\nthe resumption of peaceful agricultural pursuits and productive industries.\nThat past methods are futile to force a peace by subjugation is freely\nadmitted, and that ruin without conciliation must inevitably fail to win\nfor Spain the fidelity of a contented dependency.Decrees in application of the foreshadowed reforms have already been\npromulgated. The full text of these decrees has not been received, but as\nfurnished in a telegraphic summary from our minister are: All civil and\nelectoral rights of peninsular Spaniards are, in virtue of existing\nconstitutional authority, forthwith extended to colonial Spaniards. A\nscheme of autonomy has been proclaimed by decree, to become effective upon\nratification by the Cortes. It creates a Cuban parliament, which, with the\ninsular executive, can consider and vote upon all subjects affecting local\norder and interests, possessing unlimited powers save as to matters of\nstate, war, and the navy, as to which the Governor-General acts by his own\nauthority as the delegate of the central Government. This parliament\nreceives the oath of the Governor-General to preserve faithfully the\nliberties and privileges of the colony, and to it the colonial secretaries\nare responsible. It has the right to propose to the central Government,\nthrough the Governor-General, modifications of the national charter and to\ninvite new projects of law or executive measures in the interest of the\ncolony.Besides its local powers, it is competent, first, to regulate electoral\nregistration and procedure and prescribe the qualifications of electors and\nthe manner of exercising suffrage; second, to organize courts of justice\nwith native judges from members of the local bar; third, to frame the\ninsular budget, both as to expenditures and revenues, without limitation of\nany kind, and to set apart the revenues to meet the Cuban share of the\nnational budget, which latter will be voted by the national Cortes with the\nassistance of Cuban senators and deputies; fourth, to initiate or take part\nin the negotiations of the national Government for commercial treaties\nwhich may affect Cuban interests; fifth, to accept or reject commercial\ntreaties which the national Government may have concluded without the\nparticipation of the Cuban government; sixth, to frame the colonial tariff,\nacting in accord with the peninsular Government in scheduling articles of\nmutual commerce between the mother country and the colonies. Before\nintroducing or voting upon a bill the Cuban government or the chambers will\nlay the project before the central Government and hear its opinion thereon,\nall the correspondence in such regard being made public. Finally, all\nconflicts of jurisdiction arising between the different municipal,\nprovincial, and insular assemblies, or between the latter and the insular\nexecutive power, and which from their nature may not be referable to the\ncentral Government for decision, shall be submitted to the courts.That the government of Sagasta has entered upon a course from which\nrecession with honor is impossible can hardly be questioned; that in the\nfew weeks it has existed it has made earnest of the sincerity of its\nprofessions is undeniable. I shall not impugn its sincerity, nor should\nimpatience be suffered to embarrass it in the task it has undertaken. It is\nhonestly due to Spain and to our friendly relations with Spain that she\nshould be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations and to\nprove the asserted efficacy of the new order of things to which she stands\nirrevocably committed. She has recalled the commander whose brutal orders\ninflamed the American mind and shocked the civilized world. She has\nmodified the horrible order of concentration and has undertaken to care for\nthe helpless and permit those who desire to resume the cultivation of their\nfields to do so, and assures them of the protection of the Spanish\nGovernment in their lawful occupations. She has just released the\nCompetitor prisoners, heretofore sentenced to death, and who have been the\nsubject of repeated diplomatic correspondence during both this and the\npreceding Administration.Not a single American citizen is now in arrest or confinement in Cuba of\nwhom this Government has any knowledge. The near future will demonstrate\nwhether the indispensable condition of a righteous peace, just alike to the\nCubans and to Spain as well as equitable to all our interests so intimately\ninvolved in the welfare of Cuba, is likely to be attained. If not, the\nexigency of further and other action by the United States will remain to be\ntaken. When that time comes that action will be determined in the line of\nindisputable right and duty. It will be faced, without misgiving or\nhesitancy in the light of the obligation this Government owes to itself, to\nthe people who have confided to it the protection of their interests and\nhonor, and to humanity.Sure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourselves, actuated only\nby upright and patriotic considerations, moved neither by passion nor\nselfishness, the Government will continue its watchful care over the rights\nand property of American citizens and will abate none of its efforts to\nbring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall be honorable and\nenduring. If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty imposed by our\nobligations to ourselves, to civilization and humanity to intervene with\nforce, it shall be without fault on our part and only because the necessity\nfor such action will be so clear as to command the support and approval of\nthe civilized world.By a special message dated the 16th day of June last, I laid before the\nSenate a treaty signed that day by the plenipotentiaries of the United\nStates and of the Republic of Hawaii, having for its purpose the\nincorporation of the Hawaiian Islands as an integral part of the United\nStates and under its sovereignty. The Senate having removed the injunction\nof secrecy, although the treaty is still pending before that body, the\nsubject may be properly referred to in this Message because the necessary\naction of the Congress is required to determine by legislation many details\nof the eventual union should the fact of annexation be accomplished, as I\nbelieve it should be.While consistently disavowing from a very early period any aggressive\npolicy of absorption in regard to the Hawaiian group, a long series of\ndeclarations through three-quarters of a century has proclaimed the vital\ninterest of the United States in the independent life of the Islands and\ntheir intimate commercial dependence upon this country. At the same time it\nhas been repeatedly asserted that in no event could the entity of Hawaiian\nstatehood cease by the passage of the Islands under the domination or\ninfluence of another power than the United States. Under these\ncircumstances, the logic of events required that annexation, heretofore\noffered but declined, should in the ripeness of time come about as the\nnatural result of the strengthening ties that bind us to those Islands, and\nbe realized by the free will of the Hawaiian State.That treaty was unanimously ratified without amendment by the Senate and\nPresident of the Republic of Hawaii on the 10th of September last, and only\nawaits the favorable action of the American Senate to effect the complete\nabsorption of the Islands into the domain of the United States. What the\nconditions of such a union shall be, the political relation thereof to the\nUnited States, the character of the local administration, the quality and\ndegree of the elective franchise of the inhabitants, the extension of the\nfederal laws to the territory or the enactment of special laws to fit the\npeculiar condition thereof, the regulation if need be of the labor system\ntherein, are all matters which the treaty has wisely relegated to the\nCongress.If the treaty is confirmed as every consideration of dignity and honor\nrequires, the wisdom of Congress will see to it that, avoiding abrupt\nassimilation of elements perhaps hardly yet fitted to share in the highest\nfranchises of citizenship, and having due regard to the geographical\nconditions, the most just provisions for self-rule in local matters with\nthe largest political liberties as an integral part of our Nation will be\naccorded to the Hawaiians. No less is due to a people who, after nearly\nfive years of demonstrated capacity to fulfill the obligations of\nself-governing statehood, come of their free will to merge their destinies\nin our body-politic.The questions which have arisen between Japan and Hawaii by reason of the\ntreatment of Japanese laborers emigrating to the Islands under the\nHawaiian-Japanese convention of 1888, are in a satisfactory stage of\nsettlement by negotiation. This Government has not been invited to mediate,\nand on the other hand has sought no intervention in that matter, further\nthan to evince its kindliest disposition toward such a speedy and direct\nadjustment by the two sovereign States in interest as shall comport with\nequity and honor. It is gratifying to learn that the apprehensions at first\ndisplayed on the part of Japan lest the cessation of Hawaii's national life\nthrough annexation might impair privileges to which Japan honorably laid\nclaim, have given place to confidence in the uprightness of this\nGovernment, and in the sincerity of its purpose to deal with all possible\nulterior questions in the broadest spirit of friendliness.As to the representation of this Government to Nicaragua, Salvador, and\nCosta Rica, I have concluded that Mr. William L. Merry, confirmed as\nminister of the United States to the States of Nicaragua, Salvador and\nCosta Rica, shall proceed to San Jose, Costa Rica, and there temporarily\nestablish the headquarters of the United States to those three States. I\ntook this action for what I regarded as the paramount interests of this\ncountry. It was developed upon an investigation by the Secretary of State\nthat the Government of Nicaragua, while not unwilling to receive Mr. Merry\nin his diplomatic quality, was unable to do so because of the compact\nconcluded June 20, 1895, whereby that Republic and those of Salvador and\nHonduras, forming what is known as the Greater Republic of Central America,\nhad surrendered to the representative Diet thereof their right to receive\nand send diplomatic agents. The Diet was not willing to accept him because\nhe was not accredited to that body. I could not accredit him to that body\nbecause the appropriation law of Congress did not permit it. Mr. Baker, the\npresent minister at Managua, has been directed to present his letters of\nrecall.Mr. W. Godfrey Hunter has likewise been accredited to the Governments of\nGuatemala and Honduras, the same as his predecessor. Guatemala is not a\nmember of the Greater Republic of Central America, but Honduras is. Should\nthis latter Government decline to receive him, he has been instructed to\nreport this fact to his Government and await its further instructions.A subject of large importance to our country, and increasing appreciation\non the part of the people, is the completion of the great highway of trade\nbetween the Atlantic and Pacific, known as the Nicaragua Canal. Its utility\nand value to American commerce is universally admitted. The Commission\nappointed under date of July 24 last \"to continue the surveys and\nexaminations authorized by the act approved March 2, 1895,\" in regard to\n\"the proper route, feasibility, and cost of construction of the Nicaragua\nCanal, with a view of making complete plans for the entire work of\nconstruction of such canal,\" is now employed in the undertaking. In the\nfuture I shall take occasion to transmit to Congress the report of this\nCommission, making at the same time such further suggestions as may then\nseem advisable.Under the provisions of the act of Congress approved March 3, 1897, for the\npromotion of an international agreement respecting bimetallism, I appointed\non the 14th day of April, 1897, Hon. Edward O. Wolcott of Colorado, Hon.\nAdlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, and Hon. Charles J. Paine of Massachusetts,\nas special envoys to represent the United States. They have been diligent\nin their efforts to secure the concurrence and cooperation of European\ncountries in the international settlement of the question, but up to this\ntime have not been able to secure an agreement contemplated by their\nmission.The gratifying action of our great sister Republic of France in joining\nthis country in the attempt to bring about an agreement among the principal\ncommercial nations of Europe, whereby a fixed and relative value between\ngold and silver shall be secured, furnishes assurance that we are not alone\namong the larger nations of the world in realizing the international\ncharacter of the problem and in the desire of reaching some wise and\npractical solution of it. The British Government has published a resume of\nthe steps taken jointly by the French ambassador in London and the special\nenvoys of the United States, with whom our ambassador at London actively\nco-operated in the presentation of this subject to Her Majesty's\nGovernment. This will be laid before Congress.Our special envoys have not made their final report, as further\nnegotiations between the representatives of this Government and the\nGovernments of other countries are pending and in contemplation. They\nbelieve that doubts which have been raised in certain quarters respecting\nthe position of maintaining the stability of the parity between the metals\nand kindred questions may yet be solved by further negotiations.Meanwhile it gives me satisfaction to state that the special envoys have\nalready demonstrated their ability and fitness to deal with the subject,\nand it is to be earnestly hoped that their labors may result in an\ninternational agreement which will bring about recognition of both gold and\nsilver as money upon such terms, and with such safeguards as will secure\nthe use of both metals upon a basis which shall work no injustice to any\nclass of our citizens.In order to execute as early as possible the provisions of the third and\nfourth sections of the Revenue Act, approved July 24, 1897, I appointed the\nHon. John A. Kasson of Iowa, a special commissioner plenipotentiary to\nundertake the requisite negotiations with foreign countries desiring to\navail themselves of these provisions. The negotiations are now proceeding\nwith several Governments, both European and American. It is believed that\nby a careful exercise of the powers conferred by that Act some grievances\nof our own and of other countries in our mutual trade relations may be\neither removed, or largely alleviated, and that the volume of our\ncommercial exchanges may be enlarged, with advantage to both contracting\nparties.Most desirable from every standpoint of national interest and patriotism is\nthe effort to extend our foreign commerce. To this end our merchant marine\nshould be improved and enlarged. We should do our full share of the\ncarrying trade of the world. We do not do it now. We should be the laggard\nno longer. The inferiority of our merchant marine is justly humiliating to\nthe national pride. The Government by every proper constitutional means,\nshould aid in making our ships familiar visitors at every commercial port\nof the world, thus opening up new and valuable markets to the surplus\nproducts of the farm and the factory.The efforts which had been made during the two previous years by my\npredecessor to secure better protection to the fur seals in the North\nPacific Ocean and Bering Sea, were renewed at an early date by this\nAdministration, and have been pursued with earnestness. Upon my invitation,\nthe Governments of Japan and Russia sent delegates to Washington, and an\ninternational conference was held during the months of October and November\nlast, wherein it was unanimously agreed that under the existing regulations\nthis species of useful animals was threatened with extinction, and that an\ninternational agreement of all the interested powers was necessary for\ntheir adequate protection.The Government of Great Britain did not see proper to be represented at\nthis conference, but subsequently sent to Washington, as delegates, the\nexpert commissioners of Great Britain and Canada who had, during the past\ntwo years, visited the Pribilof Islands, and who met in conference similar\ncommissioners on the part of the United States. The result of this\nconference was an agreement on important facts connected with the condition\nof the seal herd, heretofore in dispute, which should place beyond\ncontroversy the duty of the Governments concerned to adopt measures without\ndelay for the preservation and restoration of the herd. Negotiations to\nthis end are now in progress, the result of which I hope to be able to\nreport to Congress at an early day.International arbitration cannot be omitted from the list of subjects\nclaiming our consideration. Events have only served to strengthen the\ngeneral views on this question expressed in my inaugural address. The best\nsentiment of the civilized world is moving toward the settlement of\ndifferences between nations without resorting to the horrors of war.\nTreaties embodying these humane principles on broad lines, without in any\nway imperiling our interests or our honor, shall have my constant\nencouragement.The acceptance by this Government of the invitation of the Republic of\nFrance to participate in the Universal Exposition of 1900, at Paris, was\nimmediately followed by the appointment of a special commissioner to\nrepresent the United States in the proposed exposition, with special\nreference to the securing of space for an adequate exhibit on behalf of the\nUnited States.The special commissioner delayed his departure for Paris long enough to\nascertain the probable demand for space by American exhibitors. His\ninquiries developed an almost unprecedented interest in the proposed\nexposition, and the information thus acquired enabled him to justify an\napplication for a much larger allotment of space for the American section\nthan had been reserved by the exposition authorities. The result was\nparticularly gratifying, in view of the fact that the United States was one\nof the last countries to accept the invitation of France.The reception accorded our special commissioner was most cordial, and he\nwas given every reasonable assurance that the United States would receive a\nconsideration commensurate with the proportions of our exhibit. The report\nof the special commissioner as to the magnitude and importance of the\ncoming exposition, and the great demand for space by American exhibitors,\nsupplies new arguments for a liberal and judicious appropriation by\nCongress, to the end that an exhibit fairly representative of the\nindustries and resources of our country may be made in an exposition which\nwill illustrate the world's progress during the nineteenth century. That\nexposition is intended to be the most important and comprehensive of the\nlong series of international exhibitions, of which our own at Chicago was a\nbrilliant example, and it is desirable that the United States should make a\nworthy exhibit of American genius and skill and their unrivaled\nachievements in every branch of industry.The present immediately effective force of the Navy consists of four battle\nships of the first class, two of the second, and forty-eight other vessels,\nranging from armored cruisers to torpedo boats. There are under\nconstruction five battle ships of the first class, sixteen torpedo boats,\nand one submarine boat. No provision has yet been made for the armor of\nthree of the five battle ships, as it has been impossible to obtain it at\nthe price fixed by Congress. It is of great importance that Congress\nprovide this armor, as until then the ships are of no fighting value.The present naval force, especially in view of its increase by the ships\nnow under construction, while not as large as that of a few other powers,\nis a formidable force; its vessels are the very best of each type; and with\nthe increase that should be made to it from time to time in the future, and\ncareful attention to keeping it in a high state of efficiency and repair,\nit is well adapted to the necessities of the country.The great increase of the Navy which has taken place in recent years was\njustified by the requirements for national defense, and has received public\napprobation. The time has now arrived, however, when this increase, to\nwhich the country is committed, should, for a time, take the form of\nincreased facilities commensurate with the increase of our naval vessels.\nIt is an unfortunate fact that there is only one dock on the Pacific Coast\ncapable of docking our largest ships, and only one on the Atlantic Coast,\nand that the latter has for the last six or seven months been under repair\nand therefore incapable of use. Immediate steps should be taken to provide\nthree or four docks of this capacity on the Atlantic Coast, at least one on\nthe Pacific Coast, and a floating dock in the Gulf. This is the\nrecommendation of a very competent Board, appointed to investigate the\nsubject. There should also be ample provision made for powder and\nprojectiles, and other munitions of war, and for an increased number of\nofficers and enlisted men. Some additions are also necessary to our\nnavy-yards, for the repair and care of our large number of vessels. As\nthere are now on the stocks five battle ships of the largest class, which\ncannot be completed for a year or two, I concur with the recommendation of\nthe Secretary of the Navy for an appropriation authorizing the construction\nof one battle ship for the Pacific Coast, where, at present, there is only\none in commission and one under construction, while on the Atlantic Coast\nthere are three in commission and four under construction; and also that\nseveral torpedo boats be authorized in connection with our general system\nof coast defense.The Territory of Alaska requires the prompt and early attention of\nCongress. The conditions now existing demand material changes in the laws\nrelating to the Territory. The great influx of population during the past\nsummer and fall and the prospect of a still larger immigration in the\nspring will not permit us to longer neglect the extension of civil\nauthority within the Territory or postpone the establishment of a more\nthorough government.A general system of public surveys has not yet been extended to Alaska and\nall entries thus far made in that district are upon special surveys. The\nact of Congress extending to Alaska the mining laws of the United States\ncontained the reservation that it should not be construed to put in force\nthe general land laws of the country. By act approved March 3, 1891,\nauthority was given for entry of lands for town-site purposes and also for\nthe purchase of not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres then or\nthereafter occupied for purposes of trade and manufacture. The purpose of\nCongress as thus far expressed has been that only such rights should apply\nto that Territory as should be specifically named.It will be seen how much remains to be done for that vast and remote and\nyet promising portion of our country. Special authority was given to the\nPresident by the Act of Congress approved July 24, 1897, to divide that\nTerritory into two land districts and to designate the boundaries thereof\nand to appoint registers and receivers of said land offices, and the\nPresident was also authorized to appoint a surveyor-general for the entire\ndistrict. Pursuant to this authority, a surveyor-general and receiver have\nbeen appointed, with offices at Sitka. If in the ensuing year the\nconditions justify it, the additional land district authorized by law will\nbe established, with an office at some point in the Yukon Valley. No\nappropriation, however, was made for this purpose, and that is now\nnecessary to be done for the two land districts into which the Territory is\nto be divided.I concur with the Secretary of War in his suggestions as to the necessity\nfor a military force in the Territory of Alaska for the protection of\npersons and property. Already a small force, consisting of twenty-five men,\nwith two officers, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Randall, of the\nEighth Infantry, has been sent to St. Michael to establish a military\npost.As it is to the interest of the Government to encourage the development and\nsettlement of the country and its duty to follow up its citizens there with\nthe benefits of legal machinery, I earnestly urge upon Congress the\nestablishment of a system of government with such flexibility as will\nenable it to adjust itself to the future areas of greatest population.The startling though possibly exaggerated reports from the Yukon River\ncountry, of the probable shortage of food for the large number of people\nwho are wintering there without the means of leaving the country are\nconfirmed in such measure as to justify bringing the matter to the\nattention of Congress. Access to that country in winter can be had only by\nthe passes from Dyea and vicinity, which is a most difficult and perhaps an\nimpossible task. However, should these reports of the suffering of our\nfellow-citizens be further verified, every effort at any cost should be\nmade to carry them relief.For a number of years past it has been apparent that the conditions under\nwhich the Five Civilized Tribes were established in the Indian Territory\nunder treaty provisions with the United States, with the right of\nself-government and the exclusion of all white persons from within their\nborders, have undergone so complete a change as to render the continuance\nof the system thus inaugurated practically impossible. The total number of\nthe Five Civilized Tribes, as shown by the last census, is 45,494, and this\nnumber has not materially increased; while the white population is\nestimated at from 200,000 to 250,000 which, by permission of the Indian\nGovernment has settled in the Territory. The present area of the Indian\nTerritory contains 25,694,564 acres, much of which is very fertile land.\nThe United States citizens residing in the Territory, most of whom have\ngone there by invitation or with the consent of the tribal authorities,\nhave made permanent homes for themselves. Numerous towns have been built in\nwhich from 500 to 5,000 white people now reside. Valuable residences and\nbusiness houses have been erected in many of them. Large business\nenterprises are carried on in which vast sums of money are employed, and\nyet these people, who have invested their capital in the development of the\nproductive resources of the country, are without title to the land they\noccupy, and have no voice whatever in the government either of the Nations\nor Tribes. Thousands of their children who were born in the Territory are\nof school age, but the doors of the schools of the Nations are shut against\nthem, and what education they get is by private contribution. No provision\nfor the protection of the life or property of these white citizens is made\nby the Tribal Governments and Courts.The Secretary of the Interior reports that leading Indians have absorbed\ngreat tracts of land to the exclusion of the common people, and government\nby an Indian aristocracy has been practically established, to the detriment\nof the people. It has been found impossible for the United States to keep\nits citizens out of the Territory, and the executory conditions contained\nin the treaties with these Nations have for the most part become impossible\nof execution. Nor has it been possible for the Tribal Governments to secure\nto each individual Indian his full enjoyment in common with Other Indians\nof the common property of the Nations. Friends of the Indians have long\nbelieved that the best interests of the Indians of the Five Civilized\nTribes would be found in American citizenship, with all the rights and\nprivileges which belong to that condition.By section 16, of the act of March 3, 1893, the President was authorized to\nappoint three commissioners to enter into negotiations with the Cherokee,\nChoctaw, Chickasaw, Muscogee (or Creek), and Seminole Nations, commonly\nknown as the Five Civilized Tribes in the Indian Territory. Briefly, the\npurposes of the negotiations were to be: The extinguishment of Tribal\ntitles to any lands within that Territory now held by any and all such\nNations or Tribes, either by cession of the same or some part thereof to\nthe United States, or by allotment and division of the same in severalty\namong the Indians of such Nations or Tribes respectively as may be entitled\nto the same, or by such other method as may be agreed upon between the\nseveral Nations and Tribes aforesaid, or each of them, with the United\nStates, with a view to such an adjustment upon the basis of justice and\nequity as may, with the consent of the said Nations of Indians so far as\nmay be necessary, be requisite and suitable to enable the ultimate creation\nof a State or States of the Union which shall embrace the lands within said\nIndian Territory.The Commission met much opposition from the beginning. The Indians were\nvery slow to act, and those in control manifested a decided disinclination\nto meet with favor the propositions submitted to them. A little more than\nthree years after this organization the Commission effected an agreement\nwith the Choctaw Nation alone. The Chickasaws, however, refused to agree to\nits terms, and as they have a common interest with the Choctaws in the\nlands of said Nations, the agreement with the latter Nation could have no\neffect without the consent of the former. On April 23, 1897, the Commission\neffected an agreement with both tribes--the Choctaws and Chickasaws. This\nagreement, it is understood, has been ratified by the constituted\nauthorities of the respective Tribes or Nations parties thereto, and only\nrequires ratification by Congress to make it binding.On the 27th of September, 1897, an agreement was effected with the Creek\nNation, but it is understood that the National Council of said Nation has\nrefused to ratify the same. Negotiations are yet to be had with the\nCherokees, the most populous of the Five Civilized Tribes, and with the\nSeminoles, the smallest in point of numbers and territory.The provision in the Indian Appropriation Act, approved June 10, 1896,\nmakes it the duty of the Commission to investigate and determine the rights\nof applicants for citizenship in the Five Civilized Tribes, and to make\ncomplete census rolls of the citizens of said Tribes. The Commission is at\npresent engaged in this work among the Creeks, and has made appointments\nfor taking the census of these people up to and including the 30th of the\npresent month.Should the agreement between the Choctaws and Chickasaws be ratified by\nCongress and should the other Tribes fail to make an agreement with the\nCommission, then it will be necessary that some legislation shall be had by\nCongress, which, while just and honorable to the Indians, shall be\nequitable to the white people who have settled upon these lands by\ninvitation of the Tribal Nations.Hon. Henry L. Dawes, Chairman of the Commission, in a letter to the\nSecretary of the Interior, under date of October 11, 1897, says:\n\"Individual ownership is, in their (the Commission's) opinion, absolutely\nessential to any permanent improvement in present conditions, and the lack\nof it is the root of nearly all the evils which so grievously afflict these\npeople. Allotment by agreement is the only possible method, unless the\nUnited States Courts are clothed with the authority to apportion the lands\namong the citizen Indians for whose use it was originally granted.\"I concur with the Secretary of the Interior that there can be no cure for\nthe evils engendered by the perversion of these great trusts, excepting by\ntheir resumption by the Government which created them.The recent prevalence of yellow fever in a number of cities and towns\nthroughout the South has resulted in much disturbance of commerce, and\ndemonstrated the necessity of such amendments to our quarantine laws as\nwill make the regulations of the national quarantine authorities paramount.\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, in the portion of his report relating to the\noperation of the Marine Hospital Service, calls attention to the defects in\nthe present quarantine laws, and recommends amendments thereto which will\ngive the Treasury Department the requisite authority to prevent the\ninvasion of epidemic diseases from foreign countries, and in times of\nemergency, like that of the past summer, will add to the efficiency of the\nsanitary measures for the protection of the people, and at the same time\nprevent unnecessary restriction of commerce. I concur in his\nrecommendation.In further effort to prevent the invasion of the United States by yellow\nfever, the importance of the discovery of the exact cause of the disease,\nwhich up to the present time has been undetermined, is obvious, and to this\nend a systematic bacteriological investigation should be made. I therefore\nrecommend that Congress authorize the appointment of a commission by the\nPresident, to consist of four expert bacteriologists, one to be selected\nfrom the medical officers of the Marine Hospital Service, one to be\nappointed from civil life, one to be detailed from the medical officers of\nthe Army, and one from the medical officers of the Navy.The Union Pacific Railway, Main Line, was sold under the decree of the\nUnited States Court for the District of Nebraska, on the 1st and 2d of\nNovember of this year. The amount due the Government consisted of the\nprincipal of the subsidy bonds, $27,236,512, and the accrued interest\nthereon, $31,211,711.75, making the total indebtedness, $58,448,223.75. The\nbid at the sale covered the first mortgage lien and the entire mortgage\nclaim of the Government, principal and interest.The sale of the subsidized portion of the Kansas Pacific Line, upon which\nthe Government holds a second mortgage lien, has been postponed at the\ninstance of the Government to December 16, 1897. The debt of this division\nof the Union Pacific Railway to the Government on November 1, 1897, was the\nprincipal of the subsidy bonds, $6,303,000, and the unpaid and accrued\ninterest thereon, $6,626,690.33, making a total of $12,929,690.33.The sale of this road was originally advertised for November 4, but for the\npurpose of securing the utmost public notice of the event it was postponed\nuntil December 16, and a second advertisement of the sale was made. By the\ndecree of the Court, the upset price on the sale of the Kansas Pacific will\nyield to the Government the sum of $2,500,000 over all prior liens, costs,\nand charges. If no other or better bid is made, this sum is all that the\nGovernment will receive on its claim of nearly $13,000,000. The Government\nhas no information as to whether there will be other bidders or a better\nbid than the minimum amount herein stated. The question presented therefore\nis: Whether the Government shall, under the authority given it by the act\nof March 3, 1887, purchase or redeem the road in the event that a bid is\nnot made by private parties covering the entire Government claim. To\nqualify the Government to bid at the sales will require a deposit of\n$900,000, as follows: In the Government cause $500,000 and in each of the\nfirst mortgage causes $200,000, and in the latter the deposit must be in\ncash. Payments at the sale are as follows: Upon the acceptance of the bid a\nsum which with the amount already deposited shall equal fifteen per cent of\nthe bid; the balance in installments of twenty-five per cent thirty, forty,\nand fifty days after the confirmation of the sale. The lien on the Kansas\nPacific prior to that of the Government on the 30th July, 1897, principal\nand interest, amounted to $7,281,048.11. The Government, therefore, should\nit become the highest bidder, will have to pay the amount of the first\nmortgage lien.I believe that under the act of 1887 it has the authority to do this and in\nabsence of any action by Congress I shall direct the Secretary of the\nTreasury to make the necessary deposit as required by the Court's decree to\nqualify as a bidder and to bid at the sale a sum which will at least equal\nthe principal of the debt due to the Government; but suggest in order to\nremove all controversy that an amendment of the law be immediately passed\nexplicitly giving such powers and appropriating in general terms whatever\nsum is sufficient therefor.In so important a matter as the Government becoming the possible owner of\nrailroad property which it perforce must conduct and operate, I feel\nconstrained to lay before Congress these facts for its consideration and\naction before the consummation of the sale. It is clear to my mind that the\nGovernment should not permit the property to be sold at a price which will\nyield less than one-half of the principal of its debt and less than\none-fifth of its entire debt, principal and interest. But whether the\nGovernment, rather than accept less than its claim, should become a bidder\nand thereby the owner of the property, I submit to the Congress for\naction.The Library building provided for by the act of Congress approved April 15,\n1886, has been completed and opened to the public. It should be a matter of\ncongratulation that through the foresight and munificence of Congress the\nnation possesses this noble treasure-house of knowledge. It is earnestly to\nbe hoped that having done so much toward the cause of education, Congress\nwill continue to develop the Library in every phase of research to the end\nthat it may be not only one of the most magnificent but among the richest\nand most useful libraries in the world.The important branch of our Government known as the Civil Service, the\npractical improvement of which has long been a subject of earnest\ndiscussion, has of late years received increased legislative and Executive\napproval. During the past few months the service has been placed upon a\nstill firmer basis of business methods and personal merit. While the right\nof our veteran soldiers to reinstatement in deserving cases has been\nasserted, dismissals for merely political reasons have been carefully\nguarded against, the examinations for admittance to the service enlarged\nand at the same time rendered less technical and more practical; and a\ndistinct advance has been made by giving a hearing before dismissal upon\nall cases where incompetency is charged or demand made for the removal of\nofficials in any of the Departments. This order has been made to give to\nthe accused his right to be heard but without in anyway impairing the power\nof removal, which should always be exercised in cases of inefficiency and\nincompetency, and which is one of the vital safeguards of the civil service\nreform system, preventing stagnation and deadwood and keeping every\nemployee keenly alive to the fact that the security of his tenure depends\nnot on favor but on his own tested and carefully watched record of\nservice.Much of course still remains to be accomplished before the system can be\nmade reasonably perfect for our needs. There are places now in the\nclassified service which ought to be exempted and others not classified may\nproperly be included. I shall not hesitate to exempt cases which I think\nhave been improperly included in the classified service or include those\nwhich in my judgment will best promote the public service. The system has\nthe approval of the people and it will be my endeavor to uphold and extend\nit.I am forced by the length of this Message to omit many important references\nto affairs of the Government with which Congress will have to deal at the\npresent session. They are fully discussed in the departmental reports, to\nall of which I invite your earnest attention.The estimates of the expenses of the Government by the several Departments\nwill, I am sure, have your careful scrutiny. While the Congress may not\nfind it an easy task to reduce the expenses of the Government, it should\nnot encourage their increase. These expenses will in my judgment admit of a\ndecrease in many branches of the Government without injury to the public\nservice. It is a commanding duty to keep the appropriations within the\nreceipts of the Government, and thus avoid a deficit.",
