    "date": "January 10, 1967", 
    "speech": "Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, distinguished Members of the Congress:I share with all of you the grief that you feel at the death today of one\nof the most beloved, respected, and effective Members of this body, the\ndistinguished Representative from Rhode Island, Mr. Fogarty.I have come here tonight to report to you that this is a time of testing\nfor our Nation.At home, the question is whether we will continue working for better\nopportunities for all Americans, when most Americans are already living\nbetter than any people in history.Abroad, the question is whether we have the staying power to fight a very\ncostly war, when the objective is limited and the danger to us is seemingly\nremote.So our test is not whether we shrink from our country's cause when the\ndangers to us are obvious and dose at hand, but, rather, whether we carry\non when they seem obscure and distant--and some think that it is safe to\nlay down our burdens.I have come tonight to ask this Congress and this Nation to resolve that\nissue: to meet our commitments at home and abroad--to continue to build a\nbetter America--and to reaffirm this Nation's allegiance to freedom.As President Abraham Lincoln said, \"We must ask where we are, and whither\nwe are tending.\" I.The last 3 years bear witness to our determination to make this a better\ncountry.We have struck down legal barriers to equality.We have improved the education of 7 million deprived children and this year\nalone we have enabled almost 1 million students to go to college.We have brought medical care to older people who were unable to afford it.\nThree and one-half million Americans have already received treatment under\nMedicare since July.We have built a strong economy that has put almost 3 million more Americans\non the payrolls in the last year alone.We have included more than 9 million new workers under a higher minimum\nwage.We have launched new training programs to provide job skills for almost 1\nmillion Americans.We have helped more than a thousand local communities to attack poverty in\nthe neighborhoods of the poor. We have set out to rebuild our cities on a\nscale that has never been attempted before. We have begun to rescue our\nwaters from the menace of pollution and to restore the beauty of our land\nand our countryside, our cities and our towns.We have given 1 million young Americans a chance to earn through the\nNeighborhood Youth Corps--or through Head Start, a chance to learn.So together we have tried to meet the needs of our people. And, we have\nsucceeded in creating a better life for the many as well as the few. Now we\nmust answer whether our gains shall be the foundations of further progress,\nor whether they shall be only monuments to what might have been--abandoned\nnow by a people who lacked the will to see their great work through.I believe that our people do not want to quit--though the task is great,\nthe work hard, often frustrating, and success is a matter not of days or\nmonths, but of years--and sometimes it may be even decades. II.I have come here tonight to discuss with you five ways of carrying forward\nthe progress of these last 3 years. These five ways concern programs,\npartnerships, priorities, prosperity, and peace.First, programs. We must see to it, I think, that these new programs that\nwe have passed work effectively and are administered in the best possible\nway.Three years ago we set out to create these new instruments of social\nprogress. This required trial and error--and it has produced both. But as\nwe learn, through success and failure, we are changing our strategy and we\nare trying to improve our tactics. In the long run, these starts--some\nrewarding, others inadequate and disappointing--are crucial to SUCCESS.One example is the struggle to make life better for the less fortunate\namong us.On a similar occasion, at this rostrum in 1949, I heard a great American\nPresident, Harry S. Truman, declare this: \"The American people have decided\nthat poverty is just as wasteful and just as unnecessary as preventable\ndisease.\"Many listened to President Truman that day here in this Chamber, but few\nunderstood what was required and did anything about it. The executive\nbranch and the Congress waited 15 long years before ever taking any action\non that challenge, as it did on many other challenges that great President\npresented. And when, 3 years ago, you here in the Congress joined with me\nin a declaration of war on poverty, then I warned, \"It will not be a short\nor easy struggle--no single weapon... will suffice--but we shall not rest\nuntil that war is won.\"And I have come here to renew that pledge tonight.I recommend that we intensify our efforts to give the poor a chance to\nenjoy and to join in this Nation's progress.I shall propose certain administrative changes suggested by the\nCongress--as well as some that we have learned from our own trial and\nerror.I shall urge special methods and special funds to reach the hundreds of\nthousands of Americans that are now trapped in the ghettos of our big\ncities and, through Head Start, to try to reach out to our very young,\nlittle children. The chance to learn is their brightest hope and must\ncommand our full determination. For learning brings skills; and skills\nbring jobs; and jobs bring responsibility and dignity, as well as taxes.This war--like the war in Vietnam--is not a simple one. There is no single\nbattle-line which you can plot each day on a chart. The enemy is not easy to\nperceive, or to isolate, or to destroy. There are mistakes and there are\nsetbacks. But we are moving, and our direction is forward.This is true with other programs that are making and breaking new ground.\nSome do not yet have the capacity to absorb well or wisely all the money\nthat could be put into them. Administrative skills and trained manpower are\njust as vital to their success as dollars. And I believe those skills will\ncome. But it will take time and patience and hard work. Success cannot be\nforced at a single stroke. So we must continue to strengthen the\nadministration of every program if that success is to come--as we know it\nmust.We have done much in the space of 2 short years, working together.I have recommended, and you, the Congress, have approved, 10 different\nreorganization plans, combining and consolidating many bureaus of this\nGovernment, and creating two entirely new Cabinet departments.I have come tonight to propose that we establish a new department--a\nDepartment of Business and Labor.By combining the Department of Commerce with the Department of Labor and\nother related agencies, I think we can create a more economical, efficient,\nand streamlined instrument that will better serve a growing nation.This is our goal throughout the entire Federal Government. Every program\nwill be thoroughly evaluated. Grant-in-aid programs will be improved and\nsimplified as desired by many of our local administrators and our\nGovernors.Where there have been mistakes, we will try very hard to correct them.Where there has been progress, we will try to build upon it.Our second objective is partnership--to create an effective partnership at\nall levels of government. And I should treasure nothing more than to have\nthat partnership begin between the executive and the Congress.The 88th and the 89th Congresses passed more social and economic\nlegislation than any two single Congresses in American history. Most of you\nwho were Members of those Congresses voted to pass most of those measures.\nBut your efforts will come to nothing unless it reaches the people.Federal energy is essential. But it is not enough. Only a total working\npartnership among Federal, State, and local governments can succeed. The\ntest of that partnership will be the concern of each public organization,\neach private institution, and each responsible citizen.Each State, county, and city needs to examine its capacity for government\nin today's world, as we are examining ours in the executive department, and\nas I see you are examining yours. Some will need to reorganize and reshape\ntheir methods of administration--as we are doing. Others will need to revise\ntheir constitutions and their laws to bring them up to date--as we are\ndoing. Above all, I think we must work together and find ways in which the\nmultitudes of small jurisdictions can be brought together more\nefficiently.During the past 3 years we have returned to State and local governments\nabout $40 billion in grants-in-aid. This year alone, 70 percent of our\nFederal expenditures for domestic programs will be distributed through the\nState and local governments. With Federal assistance, State and local\ngovernments by 1970 will be spending close to $110 billion annually. These\nenormous sums must be used wisely, honestly, and effectively. We intend to\nwork closely with the States and the localities to do exactly that.Our third objective is priorities, to move ahead on the priorities that we\nhave established within the resources that are available.I wish, of course, that we could do all that should be done--and that we\ncould do it now. But the Nation has many commitments and responsibilities\nwhich make heavy demands upon our total resources. No administration would\nmore eagerly utilize for these programs all the resources they require than\nthe administration that started them.So let us resolve, now, to do all that we can, with what we have--knowing\nthat it is far, far more than we have ever done before, and far, far less\nthan our problems will ultimately require.Let us create new opportunities for our children and our young Americans\nwho need special help.We should strengthen the Head Start program, begin it for children 3 years\nold, and maintain its educational momentum by following through in the\nearly years.We should try new methods of child development and care from the earliest\nyears, before it is too late to correct.And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.Let us insure that older Americans, and neglected Americans, share in their\nNation's progress.We should raise social security payments by an overall average of 20\npercent. That will add $4 billion 100 million to social security payments\nin the first year. I will recommend that each of the 23 million Americans\nnow receiving payments get an increase of at least 15 percent.I will ask that you raise the minimum payments by 59 percent--from $44 to\n$70 a month, and to guarantee a minimum benefit of $100 a month for those\nwith a total of 25 years of coverage. We must raise the limits that retired\nworkers can earn without losing social security income.We must eliminate by law unjust discrimination in employment because of\nage.We should embark upon a major effort to provide self-help assistance to the\nforgotten in our midst--the American Indians and the migratory farm\nworkers. And we should reach with the hand of understanding to help those\nwho live in rural poverty.And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.So let us keep on improving the quality of life and enlarging the meaning\nof justice for all of our fellow Americans.We should transform our decaying slums into places of decency through the\nlandmark Model Cities program. I intend to seek for this effort, this year,\nthe full amount that you in Congress authorized last year.We should call upon the genius of private industry and the most advanced\ntechnology to help rebuild our great cities.We should vastly expand the fight for dean air with a total attack on\npollution at its sources, and--because air, like water, does not respect\nmanmade boundaries--we should set up \"regional airsheds\" throughout this\ngreat land.We should continue to carry to every corner of the Nation our campaign for\na beautiful America--to dean up our towns, to make them more beautiful, our\ncities, our countryside, by creating more parks, and more seashores, and\nmore open spaces for our children to play in, and for the generations that\ncome after us to enjoy.We should continue to seek equality and justice for each citizen--before a\njury, in seeking a job, in exercising his civil rights. We should find a\nsolution to fair housing, so that every American, regardless of color, has\na decent home of his choice.We should modernize our Selective Service System. The National Commission\non Selective Service will shortly submit its report. I will send you new\nrecommendations to meet our military manpower needs. But let us resolve\nthat this is to be the Congress that made our draft laws as fair and as\neffective as possible.We should protect what Justice Brandeis called the \"right most valued by\ncivilized men\"--the right to privacy. We should outlaw all\nwiretapping--public and private--wherever and whenever it occurs, except\nwhen the security of this Nation itself is at stake--and only then with the\nstrictest governmental safeguards. And we should exercise the full reach of\nour constitutional powers to outlaw electronic \"bugging\" and \"snooping.\"I hope this Congress will try to help me do more for the consumer. We\nshould demand that the cost of credit be clearly and honestly expressed\nwhere average citizens can understand it. We should immediately take steps\nto prevent massive power failures, to safeguard the home against hazardous\nhousehold products, and to assure safety in the pipelines that carry\nnatural gas across our Nation.We should extend Medicare benefits that are now denied to 1,300,000\npermanently and totally disabled Americans under 65 years of age.We should improve the process of democracy by passing our election reform\nand financing proposals, by tightening our laws regulating lobbying, and by\nrestoring a reasonable franchise to Americans who move their residences.We should develop educational television into a vital public resource to\nenrich our homes, educate our families, and to provide assistance in our\nclassrooms. We should insist that the public interest be fully served\nthrough the public's airwaves.And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.Now we come to a question that weighs very heavily on all our minds--on\nyours and mine. This Nation must make an all-out effort to combat crime.The 89th Congress gave us a new start in the attack on crime by passing the\nLaw Enforcement Assistance Act that I recommended. We appointed the\nNational Crime Commission to study crime in America and to recommend the\nbest ways to carry that attack forward.And while we do not have all the answers, on the basis of its preliminary\nrecommendations we are ready to move.This is not a war that Washington alone can win. The idea of a national\npolice force is repugnant to the American people. Crime must be rooted out\nin local communities by local authorities. Our policemen must be better\ntrained, must be better paid, and must be better supported by the local\ncitizens that they try to serve and to protect.The National Government can and expects to help.And so I will recommend to the 90th Congress the Safe Streets and Crime\nControl Act of 1967. It will enable us to assist those States and cities\nthat try to make their streets and homes safer, their police forces better,\ntheir corrections systems more effective, and their courts more efficient.When the Congress approves, the Federal Government will be able to provide\na substantial percentage of the cost:--90 percent of the cost of developing the State and local plans, master\nplans, to combat crime in their area;--60 percent of the cost of training new tactical units, developing instant\ncommunications and special alarm systems, and introducing the latest\nequipment and techniques so that they can become weapons in the war on\ncrime;--50 percent of the cost of building crime laboratories and police\nacademy-type centers so that our citizens can be protected by the best\ntrained and served by the best equipped police to be found anywhere. We\nwill also recommend new methods to prevent juvenile delinquents from\nbecoming adult delinquents. We will seek new partnerships with States and\ncities in order to deal with this hideous narcotics problem. And we will\nrecommend strict controls on the sale of firearms.At the heart of this attack on crime must be the conviction that a free\nAmerica--as Abraham Lincoln once said--must \"let reverence for the\nlaws . . . become the political religion of the Nation.\"Our country's laws must be respected. Order must be maintained. And I will\nsupport--with all the constitutional powers the President possesses--our\nNation's law enforcement officials in their attempt to control the crime\nand the violence that tear the fabric of our communities.Many of these priority proposals will be built on foundations that have\nalready been laid. Some will necessarily be small at first, but \"every\nbeginning is a consequence.\" If we postpone this urgent work now, it will\nsimply have to be done later, and later we will pay a much higher price.Our fourth objective is prosperity, to keep our economy moving ahead,\nmoving ahead steadily and safely.We have now enjoyed 6 years of unprecedented and rewarding prosperity. Last\nyear, in 1966:--Wages were the highest in history--and the unemployment rate, announced\nyesterday, reached the lowest point in 13 years;--Total after-tax income of American families rose nearly 5 percent;--Corporate profits after taxes rose a little more than 5 percent;--Our gross national product advanced 5.5 percent, to about $740 billion;--Income per farm went up 6 percent.Now we have been greatly concerned because consumer prices rose 4.5 percent\nover the 18 months since we decided to send troops to Vietnam. This was\nmore than we had expected--and the Government tried to do everything that\nwe knew how to do to hold it down. Yet we were not as successful as we\nwished to be. In the 18 months after we entered World War II, prices rose\nnot 4.5 percent, but 13.5 percent. In the first 18 months after Korea,\nafter the conflict broke out there, prices rose not 4.5 percent, but 11\npercent. During those two periods we had OPA price control that the\nCongress gave us and War Labor Board wage controls.Since Vietnam we have not asked for those controls and we have tried to\navoid imposing them. We believe that we have done better, but we make no\npretense of having been successful or doing as well as we wished.Our greatest disappointment in the economy during 1966 was the excessive\nrise in interest rates and the tightening of credit. They imposed very\nsevere and very unfair burdens on our home buyers and on our home builders,\nand all those associated with the home industry.Last January, and again last September, I recommended fiscal and moderate\ntax measures to try to restrain the unbalanced pace of economic expansion.\nLegislatively and administratively we took several billions out of the\neconomy. With these measures, in both instances, the Congress approved most\nof the recommendations rather promptly.As 1966 ended, price stability was seemingly being restored. Wholesale\nprices are lower tonight than they were in August. So are retail food\nprices. Monetary conditions are also easing. Most interest rates have\nretreated from their earlier peaks. More money now seems to be available.Given the cooperation of the Federal Reserve System, which I so earnestly\nseek, I am confident that this movement can continue. I pledge the American\npeople that I will do everything in a President's power to lower interest\nrates and to ease money in this country. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board\ntomorrow morning will announce that it will make immediately available to\nsavings and loan associations an additional $1 billion, and will lower from\n6 percent to 5 3/4 percent the interest rate charged on those loans.We shall continue on a sensible course of fiscal and budgetary policy that\nwe believe will keep our economy growing without new inflationary spirals;\nthat will finance responsibly the needs of our men in Vietnam and the\nprogress of our people at home; that will support a significant improvement\nin our export surplus, and will press forward toward easier credit and\ntoward lower interest rates.I recommend to the Congress a surcharge of 6 percent on both corporate and\nindividual income taxes--to last for 2 years or for so long as the unusual\nexpenditures associated with our efforts in Vietnam continue. I will\npromptly recommend an earlier termination date if a reduction in these\nexpenditures permits it. This surcharge will raise revenues by some $4.5\nbillion in the first year. For example, a person whose tax payment, the tax\nhe owes, is $1,000, will pay, under this proposal, an extra $60 over the\n12-month period, or $5 a month. The overwhelming majority of Americans who\npay taxes today are below that figure and they will pay substantially less\nthan $5 a month. Married couples with two children, with incomes up to\n$5,000 per year, will be exempt from this tax--as will single people with\nan income of up to $1,900 a year.Now if Americans today still paid the income and excise tax rates in effect\nwhen I came into the Presidency, in the year 1964, their annual taxes would\nhave been over $20 billion more than at present tax rates. So this proposal\nis that while we have this problem and this emergency in Vietnam, while we\nare trying to meet the needs of our people at home, your Government asks\nfor slightly more than one-fourth of that tax cut each year in order to try\nto hold our budget deficit in fiscal 1968 within prudent limits and to give\nour country and to give our fighting men the help they need in this hour of\ntrial.For fiscal 1967, we estimate the budget expenditures to be $126.7 billion\nand revenues of $117 billion. That will leave us a deficit this year of\n$9.7 billion.For fiscal 1968, we estimate budget expenditures of $135 billion. And with\nthe tax measures recommended, and a continuing strong economy, we estimate\nrevenues will be $126.9 billion. The deficit then will be $8.1 billion.I will very soon forward all of my recommendations to the Congress. Yours\nis the responsibility to discuss and to debate them--to approve or modify or\nreject them.I welcome your views, as I have welcomed working with you for 30 years as a\ncolleague and as Vice President and President.I should like to say to the Members of the opposition--whose numbers, if I\nam not mistaken, seem to have increased somewhat--that the genius of the\nAmerican political system has always been best expressed through creative\ndebate that offers choices and reasonable alternatives. Throughout our\nhistory, great Republicans and Democrats have seemed to understand this. So\nlet there be light and reason in our relations. That is the way to a\nresponsible session and a responsive government.Let us be remembered as a President and a Congress who tried to improve the\nquality of life for every American--not just the rich, not just the poor,\nbut every man, woman, and child in this great Nation of ours.We all go to school--to good schools or bad schools. We all take air into\nour lungs--clean air or polluted air. We all drink water--pure water or\npolluted water. We all face sickness someday, and some more often than we\nwish, and old age as well. We all have a stake in this Great Society--in\nits economic growth, in reduction of civil strife--a great stake in good\ngovernment.We just must not arrest the pace of progress we have established in this\ncountry in these years. Our children's children will pay the price if we\nare not wise enough, and courageous enough, and determined enough to stand\nup and meet the Nation's needs as well as we can in the time allotted us.\nIII.Abroad, as at home, there is also risk in change. But abroad, as at home,\nthere is a greater risk in standing still. No part of our foreign policy is\nso sacred that it ever remains beyond review. We shall be flexible where\nconditions in the world change--and where man's efforts can change them for\nthe better.We are in the midst of a great transition--a transition from narrow\nnationalism to international partnership; from the harsh spirit of the cold\nwar to the hopeful spirit of common humanity on a troubled and a threatened\nplanet.In Latin America, the American chiefs of state will be meeting very shortly\nto give our hemispheric policies new direction.We have come a long way in this hemisphere since the inter-American effort\nin economic and social development was launched by the conference at Bogota\nin 1960 under the leadership of President Eisenhower. The Alliance for\nProgress moved dramatically forward under President Kennedy. There is new\nconfidence that the voice of the people is being heard; that the dignity of\nthe individual is stronger than ever in this hemisphere, and we are facing\nup to and meeting many of the hemispheric problems together. In this\nhemisphere that reform under democracy can be made to happen--because it\nhas happened. So together, I think, we must now move to strike down the\nbarriers to full cooperation among the American nations, and to free the\nenergies and the resources of two great continents on behalf of all of our\ncitizens.Africa stands at an earlier stage of development than Latin America. It has\nyet to develop the transportation, communications, agriculture, and, above\nall, the trained men and women without which growth is impossible. There,\ntoo, the job will best be done if the nations and peoples of Africa\ncooperate on a regional basis. More and more our programs for Africa are\ngoing to be directed toward self-help.The future of Africa is shadowed by unsolved racial conflicts. Our policy\nwill continue to reflect our basic commitments as a people to support those\nwho are prepared to work towards cooperation and harmony between races, and\nto help those who demand change but reject the fool's gold of violence.In the Middle East the spirit of good will toward all, unfortunately, has\nnot yet taken hold. An already tortured peace seems to be constantly\nthreatened. We shall try to use our influence to increase the possibilities\nof improved relations among the nations of that region. We are working hard\nat that task.In the great subcontinent of South Asia live more than a sixth of the\nearth's population. Over the years we--and others--have invested very\nheavily in capital and food for the economic development of India and\nPakistan.We are not prepared to see our assistance wasted, however, in conflict. It\nmust strengthen their capacity to help themselves. It must help these two\nnations--both our friends--to overcome poverty, to emerge as self-reliant\nleaders, and find terms for reconciliation and cooperation.In Western Europe we shall maintain in NATO an integrated common defense.\nBut we also look forward to the time when greater security can be achieved\nthrough measures of arms control and disarmament, and through other forms\nof practical agreement.We are shaping a new future of enlarged partnership in nuclear affairs, in\neconomic and technical cooperation, in trade negotiations, in political\nconsultation, and in working together with the governments and peoples of\nEastern Europe and the Soviet Union.The emerging spirit of confidence is precisely what we hoped to achieve\nwhen we went to work a generation ago to put our shoulder to the wheel and\ntry to help rebuild Europe. We faced new challenges and opportunities then\nand there--and we faced also some dangers. But I believe that the peoples\non both sides of the Atlantic, as well as both sides of this Chamber,\nwanted to face them together.Our relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are also in\ntransition. We have avoided both the acts and the rhetoric of the cold war.\nWhen we have differed with the Soviet Union, or other nations, for that\nmatter, I have tried to differ quietly and with courtesy, and without\nvenom.Our objective is not to continue the cold war, but to end it.We have reached an agreement at the United Nations on the peaceful uses of\nouter space.We have agreed to open direct air flights with the Soviet Union.We have removed more than 400 nonstrategic items from export control.We are determined that the Export-Import Bank can allow commercial credits\nto Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia, as well as to Romania and\nYugoslavia.We have entered into a cultural agreement with the Soviet Union for another\n2 years.We have agreed with Bulgaria and Hungary to upgrade our legations to\nembassies.We have started discussions with international agencies on ways of\nincreasing contacts with Eastern European countries.This administration has taken these steps even as duty compelled us to\nfulfill and execute alliances and treaty obligations throughout the world\nthat were entered into before I became President.So tonight I now ask and urge this Congress to help our foreign and our\ncommercial trade policies by passing an East-West trade bill and by\napproving our consular convention with the Soviet Union.The Soviet Union has in the past year increased its long-range missile\ncapabilities. It has begun to place near Moscow a limited antimissile\ndefense. My first responsibility to our people is to assure that no nation\ncan ever find it rational to launch a nuclear attack or to use its nuclear\npower as a credible threat against us or against our allies.I would emphasize that that is why an important link between Russia and the\nUnited States is in our common interest, in arms control and in\ndisarmament. We have the solemn duty to slow down the arms race between us,\nif that is at all possible, in both conventional and nuclear weapons and\ndefenses. I thought we were making some progress in that direction the\nfirst few months I was in office. I realize that any additional race would\nimpose on our peoples, and on all mankind, for that matter, an additional\nwaste of resources with no gain in security to either side.I expect in the days ahead to closely consult and seek the advice of the\nCongress about the possibilities of international agreements bearing\ndirectly upon this problem.Next to the pursuit of peace, the really greatest challenge to the human\nfamily is the race between food supply and population increase. That race\ntonight is being lost.The time for rhetoric has clearly passed. The time for concerted action is\nhere and we must get on with the job.We believe that three principles must prevail if our policy is to succeed:First, the developing nations must give highest priority to food\nproduction, including the use of technology and the capital of private\nenterprise.Second, nations with food deficits must put more of their resources into\nvoluntary family planning programs.And third, the developed nations must all assist other nations to avoid\nstarvation in the short run and to move rapidly towards the ability to feed\nthemselves.Every member of the world community now bears a direct responsibility to\nhelp bring our most basic human account into balance. IV.I come now finally to Southeast Asia--and to Vietnam in particular. Soon I\nwill submit to the Congress a detailed report on that situation. Tonight I\nwant to just review the essential points as briefly as I can.We are in Vietnam because the United States of America and our allies are\ncommitted by the SEATO Treaty to \"act to meet the common danger\" of\naggression in Southeast Asia.We are in Vietnam because an international agreement signed by the United\nStates, North Vietnam, and others in 1962 is being systematically violated\nby the Communists. That violation threatens the independence of all the\nsmall nations in Southeast Asia, and threatens the peace of the entire\nregion and perhaps the world.We are there because the people of South Vietnam have as much right to\nremain non-Communist--if that is what they choose--as North Vietnam has to\nremain Communist.We are there because the Congress has pledged by solemn vote to take all\nnecessary measures to prevent further aggression.No better words could describe our present course than those once spoken by\nthe great Thomas Jefferson:\"It is the melancholy law of human societies to be compelled sometimes to\nchoose a great evil in order to ward off a greater.\"We have chosen to fight a limited war in Vietnam in an attempt to prevent a\nlarger war--a war almost certain to follow, I believe, if the Communists\nsucceed in overrunning and taking over South Vietnam by aggression and by\nforce. I believe, and I am supported by some authority, that if they are\nnot checked now the world can expect to pay a greater price to check them\nlater.That is what our statesmen said when they debated this treaty, and that is\nwhy it was ratified 82 to 1 by the Senate many years ago.You will remember that we stood in Western Europe 20 years ago. Is there\nanyone in this Chamber tonight who doubts that the course of freedom was\nnot changed for the better because of the courage of that stand?Sixteen years ago we and others stopped another kind of aggression--this\ntime it was in Korea. Imagine how different Asia might be today if we had\nfailed to act when the Communist army of North Korea marched south. The\nAsia of tomorrow will be far different because we have said in Vietnam, as\nwe said 16 years ago in Korea: \"This far and no further.\"I think I reveal no secret when I tell you that we are dealing with a\nstubborn adversary who is committed to the use of force and terror to\nsettle political questions.I wish I could report to you that the conflict is almost over. This I\ncannot do. We face more cost, more loss, and more agony. For the end is not\nyet. I cannot promise you that it will come this year--or come next year.\nOur adversary still believes, I think, tonight, that he can go on fighting\nlonger than we can, and longer than we and our allies will be prepared to\nstand up and resist.Our men in that area--there are nearly 500,000 now--have borne well \"the\nburden and the heat of the day.\" Their efforts have deprived the Communist\nenemy of the victory that he sought and that he expected a year ago. We\nhave steadily frustrated his main forces. General Westmoreland reports that\nthe enemy can no longer succeed on the battlefield.So I must say to you that our pressure must be sustained--and will be\nsustained--until he realizes that the war he started is costing him more\nthan he can ever gain.I know of no strategy more likely to attain that end than the strategy of\n\"accumulating slowly, but inexorably, every kind of material resource\"--of\n\"laboriously teaching troops the very elements of their trade.\" That, and\npatience--and I mean a great deal of patience.Our South Vietnamese allies are also being tested tonight. Because they\nmust provide real security to the people living in the countryside. And\nthis means reducing the terrorism and the armed attacks which kidnaped and\nkilled 26,900 civilians in the last 32 months, to levels where they can be\nsuccessfully controlled by the regular South Vietnamese security forces. It\nmeans bringing to the villagers an effective civilian government that they\ncan respect, and that they can rely upon and that they can participate in,\nand that they can have a personal stake in. We hope that government is now\nbeginning to emerge.While I cannot report the desired progress in the pacification effort, the\nvery distinguished and able Ambassador, Henry Cabot Lodge, reports that\nSouth Vietnam is turning to this task with a new sense of urgency. We can\nhelp, but only they can win this part of the war. Their task is to build\nand protect a new life in each rural province.One result of our stand in Vietnam is already clear.It is this: The peoples of Asia now know that the door to independence is\nnot going to be slammed shut. They know that it is possible for them to\nchoose their own national destinies--without coercion.The performance of our men in Vietnam--backed by the American people--has\ncreated a feeling of confidence and unity among the independent nations of\nAsia and the Pacific. I saw it in their faces in the 19 days that I spent\nin their homes and in their countries. Fear of external Communist conquest\nin many Asian nations is already subsiding--and with this, the spirit of\nhope is rising. For the first time in history, a common outlook and common\ninstitutions are already emerging.This forward movement is rooted in the ambitions and the interests of Asian\nnations themselves. It was precisely this movement that we hoped to\naccelerate when I spoke at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore in April 1965, and I\npledged \"a much more massive effort to improve the life of man\" in that\npart of the world, in the hope that we could take some of the funds that we\nwere spending on bullets and bombs and spend it on schools and production.Twenty months later our efforts have produced a new reality: The doors of\nthe billion dollar Asian Development Bank that I recommended to the\nCongress, and you endorsed almost unanimously, I am proud to tell you are\nalready open. Asians are engaged tonight in regional efforts in a dozen new\ndirections. Their hopes are high. Their faith is strong. Their confidence\nis deep.And even as the war continues, we shall play our part in carrying forward\nthis constructive historic development. As recommended by the Eugene Black\nmission, and if other nations will join us, I will seek a special\nauthorization from the Congress of $200 million for East Asian regional\nprograms.We are eager to turn our resources to peace. Our efforts in behalf of\nhumanity I think need not be restricted by any parallel or by any boundary\nline. The moment that peace comes, as I pledged in Baltimore, I will ask\nthe Congress for funds to join in an international program of\nreconstruction and development for all the people of Vietnam--and their\ndeserving neighbors who wish our help.We shall continue to hope for a reconciliation between the people of\nMainland China and the world community--including working together in all\nthe tasks of arms control, security, and progress on which the fate of the\nChinese people, like their fellow men elsewhere, depends.We would be the first to welcome a China which decided to respect her\nneighbors' rights. We would be the first to applaud her were she to apply\nher great energies and intelligence to improving the welfare of her people.\nAnd we have no intention of trying to deny her legitimate needs for\nsecurity and friendly relations with her neighboring countries.Our hope that all of this will someday happen rests on the conviction that\nwe, the American people and our allies, will and are going to see Vietnam\nthrough to an honorable peace.We will support all appropriate initiatives by the United Nations, and\nothers, which can bring the several parties together for unconditional\ndiscussions of peace--anywhere, any time. And we will continue to take\nevery possible initiative ourselves to constantly probe for peace.Until such efforts succeed, or until the infiltration ceases, or until the\nconflict subsides, I think the course of wisdom for this country is that we\njust must firmly pursue our present course. We will stand firm in Vietnam.I think you know that our fighting men there tonight bear the heaviest\nburden of all. With their lives they serve their Nation. We must give them\nnothing less than our full support--and we have given them that--nothing\nless than the determination that Americans have always given their fighting\nmen. Whatever our sacrifice here, even if it is more than $5 a month, it is\nsmall compared to their own.How long it will take I cannot prophesy. I only know that the will of the\nAmerican people, I think, is tonight being tested.Whether we can fight a war of limited objectives over a period of time, and\nkeep alive the hope of independence and stability for people other than\nourselves; whether we can continue to act with restraint when the\ntemptation to \"get it over with\" is inviting but dangerous; whether we can\naccept the necessity of choosing \"a great evil in order to ward off a\ngreater\"; whether we can do these without arousing the hatreds and the\npassions that are ordinarily loosed in time of war--on all these questions\nso much turns.The answers will determine not only where we are, but \"whither we are\ntending.\"A time of testing--yes. And a time of transition. The transition is\nsometimes slow; sometimes unpopular; almost always very painful; and often\nquite dangerous.But we have lived with danger for a long time before, and we shall live\nwith it for a long time yet to come. We know that \"man is born unto\ntrouble.\" We also know that this Nation was not forged and did not survive\nand grow and prosper without a great deal of sacrifice from a great many\nmen.For all the disorders that we must deal with, and all the frustrations that\nconcern us, and all the anxieties that we are called upon to resolve, for\nall the issues we must face with the agony that attends them, let us\nremember that \"those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must, like\nmen, undergo the fatigues of supporting it.\"But let us also count not only our burdens but our blessings--for they are\nmany.And let us give thanks to the One who governs us all.Let us draw encouragement from the signs of hope--for they, too, are many.Let us remember that we have been tested before and America has never been\nfound wanting.So with your understanding, I would hope your confidence, and your support,\nwe are going to persist--and we are going to succeed.",
