    "date": "February 4, 1997", 
    "speech": "Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 105th Congress,\ndistinguished guests, my fellow Americans:I think I should start by saying thanks for inviting me back.I come before you tonight with a challenge as great as any in our peacetime\nhistory--and a plan of action to meet that challenge, to prepare our\npeople for the bold new world of the 21st century.We have much to be thankful for. With four years of growth, we have won\nback the basic strength of our economy. With crime and welfare rolls\ndeclining, we are winning back our optimism, the enduring faith that we can\nmaster any difficulty. With the Cold War receding and global commerce at\nrecord levels, we are helping to win an unrivaled peace and prosperity all\nacross the world.My fellow Americans, the state of our union is strong, but now we must rise\nto the decisive moment, to make a nation and a world better than any we\nhave ever known.The new promise of the global economy, the Information Age, unimagined new\nwork, life-enhancing technology--all these are ours to seize. That is our\nhonor and our challenge. We must be shapers of events, not observers, for\nif we do not act, the moment will pass and we will lose the best\npossibilities of our future.We face no imminent threat, but we do have an enemy. The enemy of our time\nis inaction.So tonight I issue a call to action--action by this Congress, action by\nour states, by our people to prepare America for the 21st century; action\nto keep our economy and our democracy strong and working for all our\npeople; action to strengthen education and harness the forces of technology\nand science; action to build stronger families and stronger communities and\na safer environment; action to keep America the world's strongest force for\npeace, freedom and prosperity; and above all, action to build a more\nperfect union here at home.The spirit we bring to our work will make all the difference.We must be committed to the pursuit of opportunity for all Americans,\nresponsibility from all Americans in a community of all Americans. And we\nmust be committed to a new kind of government: not to solve all our\nproblems for us, but to give our people--all our people--the tools they\nneed to make the most of their own lives. And we must work together.The people of this nation elected us all. They want us to be partners, not\npartisans. They put us all right here in the same boat. They gave us all\noars, and they told us to row. Now, here is the direction I believe we\nshould take.First, we must move quickly to complete the unfinished business of our\ncountry: to balance the budget, renew our democracy, and finish the job of\nwelfare reform.Over the last four years we have brought new economic growth by investing\nin our people, expanding our exports, cutting our deficits, creating over\n11 million new jobs, a four-year record.Now we must keep our economy the strongest in the world. We here tonight\nhave an historic opportunity. Let this Congress be the Congress that\nfinally balances the budget. Thank you.In two days I will propose a detailed plan to balance the budget by 2002.\nThis plan will balance the budget and invest in our people while protecting\nMedicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. It will balance the\nbudget and build on the vice president's efforts to make our government\nwork better--even as it costs less.It will balance the budget and provide middle-class tax relief to pay for\neducation and health care, to help to raise a child, to buy and sell a\nhome.Balancing the budget requires only your vote and my signature. It does not\nrequire us to rewrite our Constitution. I believe, I believe it is both\nunnecessary, unwise to adopt a balanced budget amendment that could cripple\nour country in time of economic crisis and force unwanted results such as\njudges halting Social Security checks or increasing taxes.Let us at least agree we should not pass any measure, no measure should be\npassed that threatens Social Security. We don't need, whatever your view on\nthat, we all must concede we don't need a constitutional amendment, we need\naction. Whatever our differences, we should balance the budget now, and\nthen, for the long-term health of our society, we must agree to a\nbipartisan process to preserve Social Security and reform Medicare for the\nlong run, so that these fundamental programs will be as strong for our\nchildren as they are for our parents.And let me say something that's not in my script tonight. I know this is\nnot going to be easy. But I really believe one of the reasons the American\npeople gave me a second term was to take the tough decisions in the next\nfour years that will carry our country through the next 50 years. I know it\nis easier for me than for you to say or do. But another reason I was\nelected is to support all of you, without regard to party, to give you what\nis necessary to join in these decisions. We owe it to our country and to\nour future.Our second piece of unfinished business requires us to commit ourselves\ntonight, before the eyes of America, to finally enacting bipartisan\ncampaign finance reform.Now, Senators McCain and Feingold, Representatives Shays and Meehan have\nreached across party lines here to craft tough and fair reform. Their\nproposal would curb spending, reduce the role of special interests, create\na level playing field between challengers and incumbents, and ban\ncontributions from non-citizens, all corporate sources, and the other large\nsoft-money contributions that both parties receive.You know and I know that this can be delayed, and you know and I know that\ndelay will mean the death of reform.So let's set our own deadline. Let's work together to write bipartisan\ncampaign finance reform into law and pass McCain-Feingold by the day we\ncelebrate the birth of our democracy, July the 4th.There is a third piece of unfinished business. Over the last four years we\nmoved a record two and a quarter million people off the welfare roles. Then\nlast year Congress enacted landmark welfare reform legislation demanding\nthat all able-bodied recipients assume the responsibility of moving from\nwelfare to work. Now each and every one of us has to fulfill our\nresponsibility, indeed our moral obligation, to make sure that people who\nnow must work can work. And now we must act to meet a new goal: two million\nmore people off the welfare rolls by the year 2000.Here is my plan: Tax credits and other incentives for businesses that hire\npeople off welfare; Incentives for job placement firms in states to create\nmore jobs for welfare recipients; Training, transportation and child care\nto help people go to work. Now I challenge every state--turn those welfare\nchecks into private sector paychecks. I challenge every religious\ncongregation, every community nonprofit, every business to hire someone off\nwelfare. And I'd like to say especially to every employer in our country\nwho ever criticized the old welfare system, you can't blame that old system\nanymore; we have torn it down. Now, do your part. Give someone on welfare\nthe chance to go to work.Tonight I am pleased to announce that five major corporations--Sprint,\nMonsanto, UPS, Burger King and United Airlines--will be the first to join\nin a new national effort to marshal America's businesses large and small to\ncreate jobs so that people can move from welfare to work.We passed welfare reform. All of you know I believe we were right to do it.\nBut no one can walk out of this chamber with a clear conscience unless you\nare prepared to finish the job.And we must join together to do something else, too, something both\nRepublican and Democratic governors have asked us to do: to restore basic\nhealth and disability benefits when misfortune strikes immigrants who came\nto this country legally, who work hard, pay taxes, and obey the law. To do\notherwise is simply unworthy of a great nation of immigrants.Now, looking ahead, the greatest step of all, the high threshold to the\nfuture we must now cross, and my number one priority for the next four\nyears, is to ensure that all Americans have the best education in the\nworld. Thank you.Let's work together to meet these three goals: every eight-year-old must be\nable to read, every 12-year-old must be able to log on to the Internet,\nevery 18-year-old must be able to go to college, and every adult American\nmust be able to keep on learning for a lifetime.My balanced budget makes an unprecedented commitment to these goals--$51\nbillion next year--but far more than money is required. I have a plan, a\ncall to action for American education based on these 10 principles:First, a national crusade for education standards--not federal government\nstandards, but national standards, representing what all our students must\nknow to succeed in the knowledge economy of the 21st century. Every state\nand school must shape the curriculum to reflect these standards and train\nteachers to lift students up to them. To help schools meet the standards\nand measure their progress, we will lead an effort over the next two years\nto develop national tests of student achievement in reading and math.Tonight I issue a challenge to the nation. Every state should adopt high\nnational standards, and by 1999, every state should test every 4th grader\nin reading and every 8th grader in math to make sure these standards are\nmet.Raising standards will not be easy, and some of our children will not be\nable to meet them at first. The point is not to put our children down, but\nto lift them up. Good tests will show us who needs help, what changes in\nteaching to make, and which schools need to improve. They can help us end\nsocial promotion, for no child should move from grade school to junior high\nor junior high to high school until he or she is ready.Last month our secretary of education, Dick Riley, and I visited northern\nIllinois, where 8th grade students from 20 school districts, in a project\naptly called First in the World, took the third International Math and\nScience Study.That's a test that reflects the world-class standards our children must\nmeet for the new era. And those students in Illinois tied for first in the\nworld in science and came in second in math. Two of them, Kristen Tanner\nand Chris Getsla, are here tonight along with their teacher, Sue Winski.\nThey're up there with the first lady, and they prove that when we aim high\nand challenge our students, they will be the best in the world. Let's give\nthem a hand. Stand up, please.Second, to have the best schools, we must have the best teachers. Most of\nus in this chamber would not be here tonight without the help of those\nteachers. I know that I wouldn't be here.For years many of our educators, led by North Carolina's governor, Jim\nHunt, and the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, have\nworked very hard to establish nationally accepted credentials for\nexcellence in teaching.Just 500 of these teachers have been certified since 1995. My budget will\nenable 100,000 more to seek national certification as master teachers. We\nshould reward and recognize our best teachers. And as we reward them, we\nshould quickly and fairly remove those few who don't measure up, and we\nshould challenge more of our finest young people to consider teaching as a\ncareer.Third, we must do more to help all our children read. Forty percent--40\npercent--of our 8-year-olds cannot read on their own. That's why we have\njust launched the America Reads initiative, to build a citizen army of one\nmillion volunteer tutors to make sure every child can read independently by\nthe end of the 3rd grade. We will use thousands of AmeriCorps volunteers to\nmobilize this citizen army. We want at least 100,000 college students to\nhelp.And tonight I'm pleased that 60 college presidents have answered my call,\npledging that thousands of their work-study students will serve for one\nyear as reading tutors.This is also a challenge to every teacher and every principal.You must use these tutors to help your students read. And it is especially\na challenge to our parents. You must read with your children every night.This leads to the fourth principle: Learning begins in the first days of\nlife. Scientists are now discovering how young children develop emotionally\nand intellectually from their very first days and how important it is for\nparents to begin immediately talking, singing, even reading to their\ninfants. The first lady has spent years writing about this issue, studying\nit. And she and I are going to convene a White House conference on early\nlearning and the brain this spring to explore how parents and educators can\nbest use these startling new findings.We already know we should start teaching children before they start school.\nThat's why this balanced budget expands Head Start to one million children\nby 2002. And that is why the vice president and Mrs. Gore will host their\nannual family conference this June on what we can do to make sure that\nparents are an active part of their children's learning all the way through\nschool.They've done a great deal to highlight the importance of family in our\nlife, and now they're turning their attention to getting more parents\ninvolved in their children's learning all the way through school. I thank\nyou, Mr. Vice President, and I thank you especially, Tipper, for what\nyou're doing.Fifth, every state should give parents the power to choose the right public\nschool for their children. Their right to choose will foster competition\nand innovation that can make public schools better. We should also make it\npossible for more parents and teachers to start charter schools, schools\nthat set and meet the highest standards and exist only as long as they do.Our plan will help America to create 3,000 of these charter schools by the\nnext century, nearly seven times as there are in the country today, so that\nparents will have even more choices in sending their children to the best\nschools.Sixth, character education must be taught in our schools. We must teach our\nchildren to be good citizens. And we must continue to promote order and\ndiscipline; supporting communities that introduce school uniforms, impose\ncurfews, enforce truancy laws, remove disruptive students from the\nclassroom, and have zero tolerance for guns and drugs in schools.Seventh, we cannot expect our children to raise themselves up in schools\nthat are literally falling down. With the student population at an all-time\nhigh, and record numbers of school buildings falling into disrepair, this\nhas now become a serious national concern. Therefore, my budget includes a\nnew initiative: $5 billion to help communities finance $20 billion in\nschool construction over the next four years.Eighth, we must make the 13th and 14th years of education--at least two\nyears of college--just as universal in America by the 21st century as a\nhigh school education is today, and we must open the doors of college to\nall Americans.To do that, I propose America's Hope Scholarship, based on Georgia's\npioneering program--two years of a $1,500 tax credit for college tuition,\nenough to pay for the typical community college. I also propose a tax\ndeduction of up to $10,000 a year for all tuition after high school, an\nexpanded IRA you can withdraw from tax free for education, and the largest\nincrease in Pell Grant scholarship in 20 years.Now this plan will give most families the ability to pay no taxes on money\nthey save for college tuition. I ask you to pass it and give every American\nwho works hard the chance to go to college.Ninth, in the 21st century we must expand the frontiers of learning across\na lifetime. All our people, of whatever age, must have the chance to learn\nnew skills.Most Americans live near a community college. The roads that take them\nthere can be paths to a better future. My GI bill for America's workers\nwill transform the confusing tangle of federal training programs into a\nsimple skill grant to go directly into eligible workers' hands.For too long this bill has been sitting on that desk there, without action.\nI ask you to pass it now. Let's give more of our workers the ability to\nlearn and to earn for a lifetime.Tenth, we must bring the power of the Information Age into all our\nschools.Last year I challenged America to connect every classroom and library to\nthe Internet by the year 2000, so that for the first time in our history,\nchildren in the most isolated rural town, the most comfortable suburbs, the\npoorest inner-city schools will have the same access to the same universe\nof knowledge.That is my plan--a call to action for American education. Some may say\nthat it is unusual for a president to pay this kind of attention to\neducation. Some may say it is simply because the president and his\nwonderful wife have been obsessed with this subject for more years than\nthey can recall. That is not what is driving these proposals. We must\nunderstand the significance of this endeavor.One of the greatest sources of our strength throughout the Cold War was a\nbipartisan foreign policy. Because our future was at stake, politics\nstopped at the water's edge. Now I ask you, and I ask all our nation's\ngovernors, I ask parents, teachers and citizens all across America, for a\nnew nonpartisan commitment to education, because education is a critical\nnational security issue for our future and politics must stop at the\nschoolhouse door.To prepare America for the 21st century, we must harness the powerful\nforces of science and technology to benefit all Americans. This is the\nfirst State of the Union carried live in video over the Internet, but we've\nonly begun to spread the benefits of a technology revolution that should\nbecome the modern birthright of every citizen.Our effort to connect every classroom is just the beginning. Now we should\nconnect every hospital to the Internet so that doctors can instantly share\ndata about their patients with the best specialists in the field.And I challenge the private sector tonight to start by connecting every\nchildren's hospital as soon as possible so that a child in bed can stay in\ntouch with school, family and friends. A sick child need no longer be a\nchild alone.We must build the second generation of the Internet so that our leading\nuniversities and national laboratories can communicate in speeds a thousand\ntimes faster than today to develop new medical treatments, new sources of\nenergy, new ways of working together. But we cannot stop there.As the Internet becomes our new town square, a computer in every home: a\nteacher of all subjects, a connection to all cultures. This will no longer\nbe a dream, but a necessity. And over the next decade, that must be our\ngoal.We must continue to explore the heavens, pressing on with the Mars probes\nand the International Space Station, both of which will have practical\napplications for our everyday living.We must speed the remarkable advances in medical science. The human genome\nproject is now decoding the genetic mysteries of life. American scientists\nhave discovered genes linked to breast cancer and ovarian cancer and\nmedication that stops a stroke in progress and begins to reverse its\neffects, and treatments that dramatically lengthen the lives of people with\nHIV and AIDS.Since I took office, funding for AIDS research at the National Institutes\nof Health has increased dramatically to $1.5 billion. With new resources,\nNIH will now become the most powerful discovery engine for an AIDS vaccine,\nworking with other scientists, to finally end the threat of AIDS. Thank\nyou. Remember that every year, every year we move up the discovery of an\nAIDS vaccine we'll save millions of lives around the world. We must\nreinforce our commitment to medical science.To prepare America for the 21st century we must build stronger families.\nOver the past four years the Family and Medical Leave Law has helped\nmillions of Americans to take time off to be with their families.With new pressures on people and the way they work and live, I believe we\nmust expand family leave so that workers can take time off for teacher\nconferences and a child's medical checkup. We should pass flex time so\nworkers can choose to be paid for overtime in income or trade it in for\ntime off to be with their families.We must continue--we must continue, step by step, to give more families\naccess to affordable quality health care. Forty million Americans still\nlack health insurance. Ten million children still lack health insurance.\nEighty percent of them have working parents who pay taxes. That is wrong.My--my balanced budget will extend health coverage to up to 5 million of\nthose children. Since nearly half of all children who lose their insurance\ndo so because their parents lose or change a job, my budget will also\nensure that people who temporarily lose their jobs can still afford to keep\ntheir health insurance. No child should be without a doctor just because a\nparent is without a job.My Medicare plan modernizes Medicare, increases the life of the trust fund\nto 10 years, provides support for respite care for the many families with\nloved ones afflicted with Alzheimer's, and, for the first time, it would\nfully pay for annual mammograms.Just as we ended drive-through deliveries of babies last year, we must now\nend the dangerous and demeaning practice of forcing women home from the\nhospital only hours after a mastectomy.I ask your support for bipartisan legislation to guarantee that a woman can\nstay in the hospital for 48 hours after a mastectomy. With us tonight is\nDr. Kristen Zarfos, a Connecticut surgeon whose outrage at this practice\nspurred a national movement and inspired this legislation. I'd like her to\nstand so we can thank her for her efforts. Dr. Zarfos, thank you.In the last four years, we have increased child support collections by 50\npercent. Now we should go further and do better by making it a felony for\nany parent to cross a state line in an attempt to flee from this, his or\nher most sacred obligation.Finally, we must also protect our children by standing firm in our\ndetermination to ban the advertising and marketing of cigarettes that\nendanger their lives.To prepare America for the 21st century, we must build stronger\ncommunities. We should start with safe streets. Serious crime has dropped\nfive years in a row. The key has been community policing. We must finish\nthe job of putting 100,000 community police on the streets of the United\nStates.We should pass the Victims' Rights Amendment to the Constitution, and I ask\nyou to mount a full-scale assault on juvenile crime, with legislation that\ndeclares war on gangs with new prosecutors and tougher penalties, extends\nthe Brady bill so violent teen criminals will not be able to buy handguns,\nrequires child safety locks on handguns to prevent unauthorized use, and\nhelps to keep our schools open after hours, on weekends and in the summer\nso our young people will have someplace to go and something to say yes to.This balanced budget includes the largest anti-drug effort ever--to stop\ndrugs at their source; punish those who push them; and teach our young\npeople that drugs are wrong, drugs are illegal, and drugs will kill them. I\nhope you will support it.Our growing economy has helped to revive poor urban and rural\nneighborhoods, but we must do more to empower them to create the conditions\nin which all families can flourish and to create jobs through investment by\nbusiness and loans by banks.We should double the number of empowerment zones. They've already brought\nso much hope to communities like Detroit, where the unemployment rate has\nbeen cut in half in four years. We should restore contaminated urban land\nand buildings to constructive use. We should expand the network of\ncommunity development banks.And together, we must pledge tonight that we will use this empowerment\napproach, including private sector tax incentives, to renew our capital\ncity so that Washington is a great place to work and live--and once again\nthe proud face America shows the world!We must protect our environment in every community. In the last four years,\nwe cleaned up 250 toxic waste sites, as many as in the previous 12. Now we\nshould clean up 500 more so that our children grow up next to parks, not\npoison. I urge to pass my proposal to make big polluters live by a simple\nrule: If you pollute our environment, you should pay to clean it up.In the last four years, we strengthened our nation's safe food and clean\ndrinking water laws; we protected some of America's rarest, most beautiful\nland in Utah's Red Rocks region; created three new national parks in the\nCalifornia desert; and began to restore the Florida Everglades.Now we must be as vigilant with our rivers as we are with our lands.\nTonight I announce that this year I will designate 10 American Heritage\nRivers to help communities alongside them revitalize their waterfronts and\nclean up pollution in the rivers, proving once again that we can grow the\neconomy as we protect the environment.We must also protect our global environment, working to ban the worst toxic\nchemicals and to reduce the greenhouse gases that challenge our health even\nas they change our climate.Now, we all know that in all of our communities some of our children simply\ndon't have what they need to grow and learn in their own homes or schools\nor neighborhoods. And that means the rest of us must do more, for they are\nour children, too. That's why President Bush, General Colin Powell, former\nHousing Secretary Henry Cisneros will join the vice president and me to\nlead the President's Summit of Service in Philadelphia in April.Our national service program, AmeriCorps, has already helped 70,000 young\npeople to work their way through college as they serve America. Now we\nintend to mobilize millions of Americans to serve in thousands of ways.\nCitizen service is an American responsibility which all Americans should\nembrace. And I ask your support for that endeavor.I'd like to make just one last point about our national community. Our\neconomy is measured in numbers and statistics. And it's very important. But\nthe enduring worth of our nation lies in our shared values and our soaring\nspirit. So instead of cutting back on our modest efforts to support the\narts and humanities I believe we should stand by them and challenge our\nartists, musicians, and writers, challenge our museums, libraries, and\ntheaters.We should challenge all Americans in the arts and humanities to join with\ntheir fellow citizens to make the year 2000 a national celebration of the\nAmerican spirit in every community, a celebration of our common culture in\nthe century that is past and in the new one to come in a new millennium so\nthat we can remain the world's beacon not only of liberty but of creativity\nlong after the fireworks have faded.To prepare America for the 21st century we must master the forces of change\nin the world and keep American leadership strong and sure for an uncharted\ntime.Fifty years ago, a farsighted America led in creating the institutions that\nsecured victory in the Cold War and built a growing world economy. As a\nresult, today more people than ever embrace our ideals and share our\ninterests. Already we have dismantled many of the blocks and barriers that\ndivided our parents' world. For the first time, more people live under\ndemocracy than dictatorship including every nation in our own hemisphere\nbut one, and its day, too, will come.Now we stand at another moment of change and choice, and another time to be\nfarsighted, to bring America 50 more years of security and prosperity.In this endeavor, our first task is to help to build for the very first\ntime an undivided, democratic Europe. When Europe is stable, prosperous,\nand at peace, America is more secure.To that end, we must expand NATO by 1999, so that countries that were once\nour adversaries can become our allies. At the special NATO summit this\nsummer, that is what we will begin to do. We must strengthen NATO's\nPartnership for Peace with non-member allies. And we must build a stable\npartnership between NATO and a democratic Russia.An expanded NATO is good for America, and a Europe in which all democracies\ndefine their future not in terms of what they can do to each other, but in\nterms of what they can do together for the good of all--that kind of\nEurope is good for America.Second, America must look to the East no less than to the West.Our security demands it. Americans fought three wars in Asia in this\ncentury.Our prosperity requires it. More than 2 million American jobs depend upon\ntrade with Asia. There, too, we are helping to shape an Asia Pacific\ncommunity of cooperation, not conflict.Let our--let our progress there not mask the peril that remains. Together\nwith South Korea, we must advance peace talks with North Korea and bridge\nthe Cold War's last divide. And I call on Congress to fund our share of the\nagreement under which North Korea must continue to freeze and then\ndismantle its nuclear weapons program.We must pursue a deeper dialogue with China for the sake of our interests\nand our ideals. An isolated China is not good for America. A China playing\nits proper role in the world is. I will go to China, and I have invited\nChina's president to come here, not because we agree on everything, but\nbecause engaging China is the best way to work on our common challenges,\nlike ending nuclear testing, and to deal frankly with our fundamental\ndifferences, like human rights.The American people must prosper in the global economy. We've worked hard\nto tear down trade barriers abroad so that we can create good jobs at home.\nI'm proud to say that today America is once again the most competitive\nnation and the No. 1 exporter in the world.Now we must act to expand our exports, especially to Asia and Latin\nAmerica, two of the fastest-growing regions on earth, or be left behind as\nthese emerging economies forge new ties with other nations. That is why we\nneed the authority now to conclude new trade agreements that open markets\nto our goods and services even as we preserve our values.We need not shrink from the challenge of the global economy. After all, we\nhave the best workers and the best products. In a truly open market, we can\nout-compete anyone, anywhere on earth.But this is about more than economics. By expanding trade, we can advance\nthe cause of freedom and democracy around the world. There is no better\nexample of this truth than Latin America where democracy and open markets\nare on the march together. That is why I will visit there in the spring to\nreinforce our important ties.We should all be proud that America led the effort to rescue our neighbor,\nMexico, from its economic crisis. And we should all be proud that last\nmonth Mexico repaid the United States, three full years ahead of schedule,\nwith half a billion dollar profit to us.America must continue to be an unrelenting force for peace. From the Middle\nEast to Haiti, from Northern Ireland to Africa, taking reasonable risks for\npeace keeps us from being drawn into far more costly conflicts later. With\nAmerican leadership, the killing has stopped in Bosnia. Now the habits of\npeace must take hold.The new NATO force will allow reconstruction and reconciliation to\naccelerate. Tonight I ask Congress to continue its strong support of our\ntroops. They are doing a remarkable job there for America, and America must\ndo right by them.Fifth, we must move strongly against new threats to our security. In the\npast four years, we agreed to ban--we led the way to a worldwide agreement\nto ban nuclear testing.With Russia, we dramatically cut nuclear arsenals and we stopped targeting\neach other's citizens. We are acting to prevent nuclear materials from\nfalling into the wrong hands, and to rid the world of land mines.We are working with other nations with renewed intensity to fight drug\ntraffickers and to stop terrorists before they act and hold them fully\naccountable if they do.Now we must rise to a new test of leadership--ratifying the Chemical\nWeapons Convention. Make no mistake about it, it will make our troops safer\nfrom chemical attack. It will help us to fight terrorism. We have no more\nimportant obligations, especially in the wake of what we now know about the\nGulf War.This treaty has been bipartisan from the beginning, supported by Republican\nand Democratic administrations, and Republican and Democratic members of\nCongress, and already approved by 68 nations. But if we do not act by April\nthe 29th, when this convention goes into force--with or without us--we\nwill lose the chance to have Americans leading and enforcing this effort.\nTogether we must make the Chemical Weapons Convention law so that at last\nwe can begin to outlaw poisoned gas from the earth.Finally, we must have the tools to meet all these challenges. We must\nmaintain a strong and ready military. We must increase funding for weapons\nmodernization by the year 2000. And we must take good care of our men and\nwomen in uniform. They are the world's finest.We must also renew our commitment to America's diplomacy and pay our debts\nand dues to international financial institutions like the World Bank--and\nto a reforming United Nations. Every dollar--every dollar we devote to\npreventing conflicts, to promoting democracy, to stopping the spread of\ndisease and starvation brings a sure return in security and savings. Yet\ninternational affairs spending today is just 1 percent of the federal\nbudget, a small fraction of what America invested in diplomacy to choose\nleadership over escapism at the start of the cold war.If America is to continue to lead the world, we here who lead America\nsimply must find the will to pay our way. A farsighted America moved the\nworld to a better place over these last 50 years. And so it can be for\nanother 50 years. But a shortsighted America will soon find its words\nfalling on deaf ears all around the world.Almost exactly 50 years ago in the first winter of the Cold War President\nTruman stood before a Republican Congress and called upon our country to\nmeet its responsibilities of leadership. This was his warning. He said, \"If\nwe falter, we may endanger the peace of the world, and we shall surely\nendanger the welfare of this nation.\"That Congress, led by Republicans like Senator Arthur Vandenburg, answered\nPresident Truman's call. Together, they made the commitments that\nstrengthened our country for 50 years. Now let us do the same. Let us do\nwhat it takes to remain the indispensable nation, to keep America strong,\nsecure and prosperous for another 50 years.In the end, more than anything else, our world leadership grows out of the\npower of our example here at home, out of our ability to remain strong as\none America.All over the world people are being torn asunder by racial, ethnic and\nreligious conflicts that fuel fanaticism and terror. We are the world's\nmost diverse democracy, and the world looks to us to show that it is\npossible to live and advance together across those kinds of differences.\nAmerica has always been a nation of immigrants.From the start, a steady stream of people in search of freedom and\nopportunity have left their own lands to make this land their home. We\nstarted as an experiment in democracy fueled by Europeans. We have grown\ninto an experiment in democratic diversity fueled by openness and promise.My fellow Americans, we must never, ever believe that our diversity is a\nweakness; it is our greatest strength.Americans speak every language, know every country. People on every\ncontinent can look to us and see the reflection of their own great\npotential, and they always will, as long as we strive to give all our\ncitizens, whatever their background, an opportunity to achieve their own\ngreatness.We're not there yet. We still see evidence of a biting bigotry and\nintolerance in ugly words and awful violence, in burned churches and bombed\nbuildings. We must fight against this in our country and in our hearts.Just a few days before my second inauguration, one of our country's\nbest-known pastors, Reverend Robert Schuller, suggested that I read Isaiah\n58:12. Here's what it says: \"Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many\ngenerations, and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach, the\nrestorer of paths to dwell in.\"I placed my hand on that verse when I took the oath of office, on behalf of\nall Americans, for no matter what our differences in our faiths, our\nbackgrounds, our politics, we must all be repairers of the breach.I want to say a word about two other Americans who show us how. Congressman\nFrank Tejeda was buried yesterday, a proud American whose family came from\nMexico. He was only 51 years old. He was awarded the Silver Star, the\nBronze Star and the Purple Heart fighting for his country in Vietnam. And\nhe went on to serve Texas and America fighting for our future here in this\nchamber.We are grateful for his service and honored that his mother, Lillie Tejeda,\nand his sister, Mary Alice, have come from Texas to be with us here\ntonight. And we welcome you. Thank you.Gary Locke, the newly-elected governor of Washington state, is the first\nChinese-American governor in the history of our country. He's the proud son\nof two of the millions of Asian American immigrants who strengthened\nAmerica with their hard work, family values and good citizenship.He represents the future we can all achieve. Thank you, governor, for being\nhere. Please stand up.Reverend Schuller, Congressman Tejeda, Governor Locke, along with Kristen\nTanner and Chris Getsla, Sue Winski and Dr. Kristen Zarfos--they're all\nAmericans from different roots whose lives reflect the best of what we can\nbecome when we are one America.We may not share a common past, but we surely do share a common future.\nBuilding one America is our most important mission, the foundation for many\ngenerations of every other strength we must build for this new century.\nMoney cannot buy it, power cannot compel it, technology cannot create it.\nIt can only come from the human spirit.America is far more than a place; it is an idea--the most powerful idea in\nthe history of nations, and all of us in this chamber, we are now the\nbearers of that idea, leading a great people into a new world.A child born tonight will have almost no memory of the 20th century.\nEverything that child will know about America will be because of what we do\nnow to build a new century. We don't have a moment to waste.Tomorrow there will be just over 1,000 days until the year 2000. One\nthousand days to prepare our people. One thousand days to work together.\nOne thousand days to build a bridge to a land of new promise.My fellow Americans, we have work to do. Let us seize those days and the\ncentury.Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America.",
