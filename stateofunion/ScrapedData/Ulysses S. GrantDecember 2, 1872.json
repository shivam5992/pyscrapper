    "speech": "To the Senate and House of Representatives:In transmitting to you this my fourth annual message it is with\nthankfulness to the Giver of All Good that as a nation we have been blessed\nfor the past year with peace at home, peace abroad, and a general\nprosperity vouchsafed to but few peoples.With the exception of the recent devastating fire which swept from the\nearth with a breath, as it were, millions of accumulated wealth in the city\nof Boston, there has been no overshadowing calamity within the year to\nrecord. It is gratifying to note how, like their fellow-citizens of the\ncity of Chicago under similar circumstances a year earlier, the citizens of\nBoston are rallying under their misfortunes, and the prospect that their\nenergy and perseverance will overcome all obstacles and show the same\nprosperity soon that they would had no disaster befallen them. Otherwise we\nhave been free from pestilence, war, and calamities, which often overtake\nnations; and, as far as human judgment can penetrate the future, no cause\nseems to exist to threaten our present peace.When Congress adjourned in June last, a question had been raised by Great\nBritain, and was then pending, which for a time seriously imperiled the\nsettlement by friendly arbitration of the grave differences between this\nGovernment and that of Her Britannic Majesty, which by the treaty of\nWashington had been referred to the tribunal of arbitration which had met\nat Geneva, in Switzerland.The arbitrators, however, disposed of the question which had jeoparded the\nwhole of the treaty and threatened to involve the two nations in most\nunhappy relations toward each other in a manner entirely satisfactory to\nthis Government and in accordance with the views and the policy which it\nhad maintained.The tribunal, which had convened at Geneva in December, concluded its\nlaborious session on the 14th day of September last, on which day, having\navailed itself of the discretionary power given to it by the treaty to\naward a sum in gross, it made its decision, whereby it awarded the sum of\n$15,500,000 in gold as the indemnity to be paid by Great Britain to the\nUnited States for the satisfaction of all the claims referred to its\nconsideration.This decision happily disposes of a long-standing difference between the\ntwo Governments, and, in connection with another award, made by the German\nEmperor under a reference to him by the same treaty, leaves these two\nGovernments without a shadow upon the friendly relations which it is my\nsincere hope may forever remain equally unclouded.The report of the agent of the United States appointed to attend the Geneva\ntribunal, accompanied by the protocols of the proceedings of the\narbitrators, the arguments of the counsel of both Governments, the award of\nthe tribunal, and the opinions given by the several arbitrators, is\ntransmitted herewith.I have caused to be communicated to the heads of the three friendly powers\nwho complied with the joint request made to them under the treaty the\nthanks of this Government for the appointment of arbitrators made by them\nrespectively, and also my thanks to the eminent personages named by them,\nand my appreciation of the dignity, patience, impartiality, and great\nability with which they discharged their arduous and high functions.Her Majesty's Government has communicated to me the appreciation by Her\nMajesty of the ability and indefatigable industry displayed by Mr. Adams,\nthe arbitrator named on the part of this Government during the protracted\ninquiries and discussions of the tribunal. I cordially unite with Her\nMajesty in this appreciation.It is due to the agent of the United States before the tribunal to record\nmy high appreciation of the marked ability, unwearied patience, and the\nprudence and discretion with which he has conducted the very responsible\nand delicate duties committed to him, as it is also due to the learned and\neminent counsel who attended the tribunal on the part of this Government to\nexpress my sense of the talents and wisdom which they brought to bear in\nthe attainment of the result so happily reached.It will be the province of Congress to provide for the distribution among\nthose who may be entitled to it of their respective shares of the money to\nbe paid. Although the sum awarded is not payable until a year from the date\nof the award, it is deemed advisable that no time be lost in making a\nproper examination of the several cases in which indemnification may be\ndue. I consequently recommend the creation of a board of commissioners for\nthe purpose.By the thirty-fourth article of the treaty of Washington the respective\nclaims of the United States and of Great Britain in their construction of\nthe treaty of the 15th of June, 1846, defining the boundary line between\ntheir respective territories, were submitted to the arbitration and award\nof His Majesty the Emperor of Germany, to decide which of those claims is\nmost in accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty of 1846.His Majesty the Emperor of Germany, having been pleased to undertake the\narbitration, has the earnest thanks of this Government and of the people of\nthe United States for the labor, pains, and care which he has devoted to\nthe consideration of this long-pending difference. I have caused an\nexpression of my thanks to be communicated to His Majesty. Mr. Bancroft,\nthe representative of this Government at Berlin, conducted the case and\nprepared the statement on the part of the United States with the ability\nthat his past services justified the public in expecting at his hands. As a\nmember of the Cabinet at the date of the treaty which has given rise to the\ndiscussion between the two Governments, as the minister to Great Britain\nwhen the construction now pronounced unfounded was first advanced, and as\nthe agent and representative of the Government to present the case and to\nreceive the award, he has been associated with the question in all of its\nphases, and in every stage has manifested a patriotic zeal and earnestness\nin maintenance of the claim of the United States. He is entitled to much\ncredit for the success which has attended the submission.After a patient investigation of the case and of the statements of each\nparty, His Majesty the Emperor, on the 21st day of October last, signed his\naward in writing, decreeing that the claim of the Government of the United\nStates, that the boundary line between the territories of Her Britannic\nMajesty and the United States should be drawn through the Haro Channel, is\nmost in accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty concluded on\nthe 15th of June, 1846, between the Governments of Her Britannic Majesty\nand of the United States.Copies of the \"case\" presented on behalf of each Government, and of the\n\"statement in reply\" of each, and a translation of the award, are\ntransmitted herewith.This award confirms the United States in their claim to the important\narchipelago of islands lying between the continent and Vancouvers Island,\nwhich for more than twenty-six years (ever since the ratification of the\ntreaty) Great Britain has contested, and leaves us, for the first time in\nthe history of the United States as a nation, without a question of\ndisputed boundary between our territory and the possessions of Great\nBritain on this continent.It is my grateful duty to acknowledge the prompt, spontaneous action of Her\nMajesty's Government in giving effect to the award. In anticipation of any\nrequest from this Government, and before the reception in the United States\nof the award signed by the Emperor, Her Majesty had given instructions for\nthe removal of her troops which had been stationed there and for the\ncessation of all exercise or claim of jurisdiction, so as to leave the\nUnited States in the exclusive possession of the lately disputed territory.\nI am gratified to be able to announce that the orders for the removal of\nthe troops have been executed, and that the military joint occupation of\nSan Juan has ceased. The islands are now in the exclusive possession of the\nUnited States.It now becomes necessary to complete the survey and determination of that\nportion of the boundary line (through the Haro Channel) upon which the\ncommission which determined the remaining part of the line were unable to\nagree. I recommend the appointment of a commission to act jointly with one\nwhich may be named by Her Majesty for that purpose.Experience of the difficulties attending the determination of our admitted\nline of boundary, after the occupation of the territory and its settlement\nby those owing allegiance to the respective Governments, points to the\nimportance of establishing, by natural objects or other monuments, the\nactual line between the territory acquired by purchase from Russia and the\nadjoining possessions of Her Britannic Majesty. The region is now so\nsparsely occupied that no conflicting interests of individuals or of\njurisdiction are likely to interfere to the delay or embarrassment of the\nactual location of the line. If deferred until population shall enter and\noccupy the territory, some trivial contest of neighbors may again array the\ntwo Governments in antagonism. I therefore recommend the appointment of a\ncommission, to act jointly with one that may be appointed on the part of\nGreat Britain, to determine the line between our Territory of Alaska and\nthe conterminous possessions of Great Britain.In my last annual message I recommended the legislation necessary on the\npart of the United States to bring into operation the articles of the\ntreaty of Washington of May 8, 1871, relating to the fisheries and to other\nmatters touching the relations of the United States toward the British\nNorth American possessions, to become operative so soon as the proper\nlegislation should be had on the part of Great Britain and its\npossessions.That legislation on the part of Great Britain and its possessions had not\nthen been had, and during the session of Congress a question was raised\nwhich for the time raised a doubt whether any action by Congress in the\ndirection indicated would become important. This question has since been\ndisposed of, and I have received notice that the Imperial Parliament and\nthe legislatures of the provincial governments have passed laws to carry\nthe provisions of the treaty on the matters referred to into operation. I\ntherefore recommend your early adoption of the legislation in the same\ndirection necessary on the part of this Government.The joint commission for determining the boundary line between the United\nStates and the British possessions between the Lake of the Woods and the\nRocky Mountains has organized and entered upon its work. It is desirable\nthat the force be increased, in order that the completion of the survey and\ndetermination of the line may be the sooner attained. To this end I\nrecommend that a sufficient appropriation be made.With France, our earliest ally; Russia, the constant and steady friend of\nthe United States; Germany, with whose Government and people we have so\nmany causes of friendship and so many common sympathies, and the other\npowers of Europe, our relations are maintained on the most friendly terms.Since my last annual message the exchange has been made of the\nratifications of a treaty with the Austro-Hungarian Empire relating to\nnaturalization; also of a treaty with the German Empire respecting consuls\nand trade-marks; also of a treaty with Sweden and Norway relating to\nnaturalization; all of which treaties have been duly proclaimed.Congress at its last session having made an appropriation to defray the\nexpense of commissioners on the part of the United States to the\nInternational Statistical Congress at St. Petersburg, the persons appointed\nin that character proceeded to their destination and attended the sessions\nof the congress. Their report shall in due season be laid before you. This\ncongress meets at intervals of about three years, and has held its sessions\nin several of the countries of Europe. I submit to your consideration the\npropriety of extending an invitation to the congress to hold its next\nmeeting in the United States. The Centennial Celebration to be held in 1876\nwould afford an appropriate occasion for such meeting.Preparations are making for the international exposition to be held during\nthe next year in Vienna, on a scale of very great magnitude. The tendency\nof these expositions is in the direction of advanced civilization, and of\nthe elevation of industry and of labor, and of the increase of human\nhappiness, as well as of greater intercourse and good will between nations.\nAs this exposition is to be the first which will have been held in eastern\nEurope, it is believed that American inventors and manufacturers will be\nready to avail themselves of the opportunity for the presentation of their\nproductions if encouraged by proper aid and protection.At the last session of Congress authority was given for the appointment of\none or more agents to represent this Government at the exposition. The\nauthority thus given has been exercised, but, in the absence of any\nappropriation, there is danger that the important benefits which the\noccasion offers will in a large degree be lost to citizens of the United\nStates. I commend the subject strongly to your consideration, and recommend\nthat an adequate appropriation be made for the purpose.To further aid American exhibitors at the Vienna Exposition, I would\nrecommend, in addition to an appropriation of money, that the Secretary of\nthe Navy be authorized to fit up two naval vessels to transport between our\nAtlantic cities and Trieste, or the most convenient port to Vienna, and\nback, their articles for exhibition.Since your last session the President of the Mexican Republic,\ndistinguished by his high character and by his services to his country, has\ndied. His temporary successor has now been elected with great unanimity by\nthe people a proof of confidence on their part in his patriotism and wisdom\nwhich it is believed will be confirmed by the results of his\nadministration. It is particularly desirable that nothing should be left\nundone by the Government of either Republic to strengthen their relations\nas neighbors and friends.It is much to be regretted that many lawless acts continue to disturb the\nquiet of the settlements on the border between our territory and that of\nMexico, and that complaints of wrongs to American citizens in various parts\nof the country are made. The revolutionary condition in which the\nneighboring Republic has so long been involved has in some degree\ncontributed to this disturbance. It is to be hoped that with a more settled\nrule of order through the Republic, which may be expected from the present\nGovernment, the acts of which just complaint is made will cease.The proceedings of the commission under the convention with Mexico of the\n4th of July, 1868, on the subject of claims, have, unfortunately, been\nchecked by an obstacle, for the removal of which measures have been taken\nby the two Governments which it is believed will prove successful.The commissioners appointed, pursuant to the joint resolution of Congress\nof the 7th of May last, to inquire into depredations on the Texan frontier\nhave diligently made investigations in that quarter. Their report upon the\nsubject will be communicated to you. Their researches were necessarily\nincomplete, partly on account of the limited appropriation made by\nCongress. Mexico, on the part of that Government, has appointed a similar\ncommission to investigate these outrages. It is not announced officially,\nbut the press of that country states that the fullest investigation is\ndesired, and that the cooperation of all parties concerned is invited to\nsecure that end. I therefore recommend that a special appropriation be made\nat the earliest day practicable, to enable the commissioners on the part of\nthe United States to return to their labors without delay.It is with regret that I have again to announce a continuance of the\ndisturbed condition of the island of Cuba. No advance toward the\npacification of the discontented part of the population has been made.\nWhile the insurrection has gained no advantages and exhibits no more of the\nelements of power or of the prospects of ultimate success than were\nexhibited a year ago, Spain, on the other hand, has not succeeded in its\nrepression, and the parties stand apparently in the same relative attitude\nwhich they have occupied for a long time past.This contest has lasted now for more than four years. Were its scene at a\ndistance from our neighborhood, we might be indifferent to its result,\nalthough humanity could not be unmoved by many of its incidents wherever\nthey might occur. It is, however, at our door.I can not doubt that the continued maintenance of slavery in Cuba is among\nthe strongest inducements to the continuance of this strife. A terrible\nwrong is the natural cause of a terrible evil. The abolition of slavery and\nthe introduction of other reforms in the administration of government in\nCuba could not fail to advance the restoration of peace and order. It is\ngreatly to be hoped that the present liberal Government of Spain will\nvoluntarily adopt this view.The law of emancipation, which was passed more than two years since, has\nremained unexecuted in the absence of regulations for its enforcement. It\nwas but a feeble step toward emancipation, but it was the recognition of\nright, and was hailed as such, and exhibited Spain in harmony with\nsentiments of humanity and of justice and in sympathy with the other powers\nof the Christian and civilized world.Within the past few weeks the regulations for carrying out the law of\nemancipation have been announced, giving evidence of the sincerity of\nintention of the present Government to carry into effect the law of 1870. I\nhave not failed to urge the consideration of the wisdom, the policy, and\nthe justice of a more effective system for the abolition of the great evil\nwhich oppresses a race and continues a bloody and destructive contest close\nto our border, as well as the expediency and the justice of conceding\nreforms of which the propriety is not questioned.Deeply impressed with the conviction that the continuance of slavery is one\nof the most active causes of the continuance of the unhappy condition in\nCuba, I regret to believe that citizens of the United States, or those\nclaiming to be such, are large holders in Cuba of what is there claimed as\nproperty, but which is forbidden and denounced by the laws of the United\nStates. They are thus, in defiance of the spirit of our own laws,\ncontributing to the continuance of this distressing and sickening contest.\nIn my last annual message I referred to this subject, and I again recommend\nsuch legislation as may be proper to denounce, and, if not prevent, at\nleast to discourage American citizens from holding or dealing in slaves.It is gratifying to announce that the ratifications of the convention\nconcluded under the auspices of this Government between Spain on the one\npart and the allied Republics of the Pacific on the other, providing for an\narmistice, have been exchanged. A copy of the instrument is herewith\nsubmitted. It is hoped that this may be followed by a permanent peace\nbetween the same parties.The differences which at one time threatened the maintenance of peace\nbetween Brazil and the Argentine Republic it is hoped are in the way of\nsatisfactory adjustment.With these States, as with the Republics of Central and of South America,\nwe continue to maintain the most friendly relations.It is with regret, however, I announce that the Government of Venezuela has\nmade no further payments on account of the awards under the convention of\nthe 25th of April, 1866. That Republic is understood to be now almost, if\nnot quite, tranquilized. It is hoped, therefore, that it will lose no time\nin providing for the unpaid balance of its debt to the United States,\nwhich, having originated in injuries to our citizens by Venezuelan\nauthorities, and having been acknowledged, pursuant to a treaty, in the\nmost solemn form known among nations, would seem to deserve a preference\nover debts of a different origin and contracted in a different manner. This\nsubject is again recommended to the attention of Congress for such action\nas may be deemed proper.Our treaty relations with Japan remain unchanged. An imposing embassy from\nthat interesting and progressive nation visited this country during the\nyear that is passing, but, being unprovided with powers for the signing of\na convention in this country, no conclusion in that direction was reached.\nIt is hoped, however, that the interchange of opinions which took place\nduring their stay in this country has led to a mutual appreciation of the\ninterests which may be promoted when the revision of the existing treaty\nshall be undertaken.In this connection I renew my recommendation of one year ago, that--To give importance to and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic\nrelations with Japan and China, and to further aid in retaining the good\nopinion of those peoples, and to secure to the United States its share of\nthe commerce destined to flow between those nations and the balance of the\ncommercial world, an appropriation be made to support at least four\nAmerican youths in each of those countries, to serve as a part of the\nofficial family of our ministers there. Our representatives would not even\nthen be placed upon an equality with the representatives of Great Britain\nand of some other powers. As now situated, our representatives in Japan and\nChina have to depend for interpreters and translators upon natives of those\ncountries, who know our language imperfectly, or procure for the occasion\nthe services of employees in foreign business houses or the interpreters to\nother foreign ministers.I renew the recommendation made on a previous occasion, of the transfer to\nthe Department of the Interior, to which they seem more appropriately to\nbelong, of all the powers and duties in relation to the Territories with\nwhich the Department of State is now charged by law or by custom.Congress from the beginning of the Government has wisely made provision for\nthe relief of distressed seamen in foreign countries. No similar provision,\nhowever, has hitherto been made for the relief of citizens in distress\nabroad other than seamen. It is understood to be customary with other\ngovernments to authorize consuls to extend such relief to their citizens or\nsubjects in certain cases. A similar authority and an appropriation to\ncarry it into effect are recommended in the case of citizens of the United\nStates destitute or sick under such circumstances. It is well known that\nsuch citizens resort to foreign countries in great numbers. Though most of\nthem are able to bear the expenses incident to locomotion, there are some\nwho, through accident or otherwise, become penniless, and have no friends\nat home able to succor them. Persons in this situation must either perish,\ncast themselves upon the charity of foreigners, or be relieved at the\nprivate charge of our own officers, who usually, even with the most\nbenevolent dispositions, have nothing to spare for such purposes.Should the authority and appropriation asked for be granted, care will be\ntaken so to carry the beneficence of Congress into effect that it shall not\nbe unnecessarily or unworthily bestowed.
